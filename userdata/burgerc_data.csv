The Holdovers,14 Jan 2024,★★★½,False,Dead Poets Society II: Opposite Teacher! I thought this story was so sweet but I was fatigued by the iMovie “fade” transition betwixt every shot and furthermore why did they pan like that down every hallway/highway. Hilarious that the other kids last name is “cuntz” also
Poor Things,13 Jan 2024,★★★★★,False,"An OUTSTANDING motion picture and a shining example of the fact that art needs pervs and pervs need art. Whimsy and empiricism are not at war, they are singing a duet onstage at the dinner theater!!!!! They are spitting in the face of nihilism and monoculture. They are French kissing on top of the dining table!!!! There goes the fine china!!!!"
All of Us Strangers,04 Jan 2024,★★★★★,False,"They built this movie in a lab to destroy me and others. One of the most heartbreaking things that could happen in general is looking at old stuff (photos, notebook w your childhood handwriting, etc.) imagine that times a billion. That’s this movie 😔😔😔"
Dune,02 Jan 2024,★,False,My friend made me watch most of this on New Year’s Day but I was forced to give up …..it’s so nasty and wrong how much they all care about that big ass worm!!!!
The Devil Wears Prada,02 Jan 2024,★★★★★,False,Second rewatch in the last two calendar months. Best movie ever made possibly………… also it seems like I remembered I had a letterboxd in 2019 and just.. added every movie I watched for a college class that year + any other movie I could remember watching in my entire life???? The whole point of this app is to be cool and brag and I fumbled it. Fucking humiliating. That must be how Andy Sachs felt when Emily said “don’t you have some hideous skirt convention to attend?” Hilarious burn. No wonder John Krasinski is a wife guy!!!!
Wonka,01 Jan 2024,★★★,False,"This thang was adorable!!! Timothee doesn’t have enough whimsy they should’ve cast a total freak but whateva. Nobody was good at singing which I liked, and the art department went crazy when they opened that storefront that got burnt to a crisp :( so sad legit. Anyway I liked it"
The Iron Claw,30 Dec 2023,★★★★,False,It was so fucking sad and nobody warned me :(
American Fiction,25 Dec 2023,★★½,False,I hated the soundtrack sooooooo much all I could hear the whole movie was someone tickling those delicate ivories and it was so distracting and a tonal miss imo!!! Also why’d they kill tracee Ellis Ross??? Not cool. Jeffrey wright good at acting methinks
The Boy and the Heron,13 Dec 2023,★★★,False,I was freaked out then I fell asleep but I thought it was special as well and I feel like they worked really hard on it. Did Robert Pattinson voice someone in this????? Idk. Congrats to him + Suki Waterhouse on the baby that kid is gonna be so weird
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,29 Nov 2023,★★,False,Dude’s a total freak so is viola Davis I love her
