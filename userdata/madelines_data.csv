No Hard Feelings,21 Jul 2023,★★★½,True," A very fun watching experience. This movie was not a masterpiece, but that didn’t matter to me because I had such a joyful time watching it in the theater. This movie was a great combination for awkward and funny (even though it had some flops joke-wise). It had the right amounts of wholesomeness and drama peppered throughout. And honestly sometimes this movie was just NUTS!!! But that increased the appeal for me. Also just want to give Jennifer Lawrence her… "
Barbie,21 Jul 2023,★★★,False," Like but didn’t love. I feel like unless this movie was perfection in all categories, it would not live up to the high expectations that most people had for it. In a way, all of the hype and promotion for this movie put it at a disadvantage in terms of how people would feel about it. With all of that in consideration, I thought that  the movie as a whole was somewhere between fine and good, but definitely not great. … "
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,03 Mar 2023,★★,False,"I honestly don’t know how to rate this movie as a whole. I fell asleep during it in the movie theater because it was slow and kind of boring.

Eddie's Million Dollar Cook Off,24 Aug 2021,★★★★,True,"A baseball player with a secret passion for cooking is a good concept and the movie had a good message about doing what you love. But what made this movie good were how multiple characters were experiencing similar situations and moments of growth. Seeing their stories play out alongside one another was interesting. Also, this movie has some great stand-out scenes like the food fights and when the team confronts the sexist coach, like I love that!"
