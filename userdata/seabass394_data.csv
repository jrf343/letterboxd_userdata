Snowpiercer,09 Jan 2024,★★★,False," unfortunately, not as good as I remembered. although I’m happy with the amount of violence in this movie, that bong joon ho does is best to conceal it. however, the shaky camera angles were more nauseating and distracting more than anything else. although I’m actually quite impressed with the number of characters in these movies and the amount of depth they give certain side characters. it nevertheless feels rushed. Chris Evan’s monologue near the end when it’s revealed that Edgar… "
The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie,08 Jan 2024,★★★½,True,"this was my first Luis Buñuel flick and it honestly rocked. I was not expecting this to be as surreal as it was. there were certain dream sequences that were gripping and boring (ie the lieutenant killing his pseudo-father, the ghost police man?) but other moments were filled with an absurdity and ridiculousness that only made the main 6’s blase, indifferent attitude even more funny. a depressing reminder that for rich people, their biggest nightmare is interrupting lunch/dinner. my favorite cinematic shots were the six aimlessly wandering in an empty street"
Reality,26 Dec 2023,★★★½,True," put this on to watch with my parents and they instantly fell asleep which was fine because I enjoyed this movie quite a lot. I think having the transcript serve as the literal script of the movie certainly lead to a blurring of lines between fact and fiction that I found very engaging. the first time I saw the me talking about redacted information, I found it honestly terrifying. when I first watched this, I thought it was a really… "
Barbie,26 Dec 2023,★★½,False, I was going into this ready to give this corporate BS a 1/2. but it pleasantly surprised me so im bumping it to 2 1/2. there were certainly moments where i burst out laughing like the Ken’s obsessing over the godfather and Lou reed. and Barbie being called a fascist. and Ken discovering the patriarchy. most of the ken plot line I found a lot more entertaining than the Barbie plot line….but maybe it’s my male perspective. idk. while I’m… 
Ocean's Twelve,23 Dec 2023,★★,False, not nearly as good as the first one. the plot is surprisingly convuluted and action-less. oceans eleven was just as complex but very easy to follow. with the amount of time skips/flashbacks it was very difficult to deserve chronology. the goal of the gang also seems to shift quite often as soon as they are snubbed by the fox. I do like Brad Pitt’s and Catherine Zeta Jones dynamic. I thought it was believable and suspenseful. the rest of the… 
Saltburn,21 Dec 2023,★★★★,True," this one was a fun mess. it was honestly incredibly entertaining. the whole “eat the rich” trend in Hollywood is honestly getting old so fast. the menu and triangle of sadness were both mid but force majeure and SALTBURN take the cake in unraveling the upper class. this one was incredibly shocking. hilarious. long. and overall raucous from beginning to end. especially in the final twist in the end, it reminded me a lot of parasite. the erotic scenes were… "
Ocean's Eleven,01 Dec 2023,★★★★★,True," another freaking masterpiece. intense. hilarious. cool. fast. everything that you would want in a heist movie (did this movie invent the genre?) this ensemble cast rocked with notable performances from don cheadle, Bernie Mac, and Elliott Gould. AND THE FUCKING MORMON TWINS! they were easily one of the best highlights of the movie. a movie that’s not afraid to linger and show the characters in their element. it takes a lot of patience until the movie starts going but when… "
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb,29 Nov 2023,★★★★★,True,a satirical masterpiece. truly hilarious from start to finish. the fluoride in the water. the lack of fish in the war room buffet. “mein fuhrer I can walk.” the destruction of the coke vending machine. the b-52 pilot hero team. it was incredibly succinct. no fat whatsoever. love a 90 minute movie. the comedic timing of both the actors and the edits are hilarious. it made me burst out laughing multiple times. perfectly encapsulates the absurd mania of the Cold War and how really it’s just a bunch of idiots running the world.
Battle Royale,28 Nov 2023,★★★★½,True," yeah…I’m thinking it’s a masterpiece. the only version available on tubi was dubbed and OH MY GOD. it was fucking hilarious. the random swearing at times, the voice actors, the inability to pronounce Japanese names. original hunger games type beat. this was a lot more intense, thrilling, and batshit crazy. my eyes were glued to the screen the entire time. my favorite moments may or may not include the lighthouse girls shootout, grenade in severed head moment, girls regretting using… "
Snatch,26 Nov 2023,★★★★★,True," watched this with my dad when we couldn’t put on the football game on Sunday. WHAT A PERFECT MOVIE. certainly a movie for the fellas (there is very present lack of women in this movie). With so many characters, there’s a fear that some characters might fall between the cracks, but not a single character is lacking. They are uniquely stubborn, flawed, and hilarious. the pacing is going at bullet speed. sub-plots and schemes seem to accelerate at lightning speed.… "
The Killer,22 Nov 2023,★★★,True," I actually was really looking forward to this one and was expecting a banger, however this simply wasn’t the case. The Killer set up a lot of cool themes, characters, and circumstances, however it quickly devolved into le basic revenge murder plot. you touched my non descript Latina girlfriend, I will now kill all of you. the anxiety-ridden, meticulous murder brain was done a lot better in The House That Jack Built. I’ll give credit where credit is due. The… "
Suspiria,21 Oct 2023,★★★½,True," the most vibrant and disturbing movie. I’ve seen in a while. while watching this, it reminded me a lot of Midsommar. just like the beautiful Nordic fields of Midsommar, nothing is hidden in the colorful fun house that is Suspiria’s dance academy. this movie also reminded me alot of dance moms. for a movie taking place in a dance academy there is not that much dancing like in Black Swan. the acting borderlines on bad but they entire movie is… "
