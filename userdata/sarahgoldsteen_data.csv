The Last of Sheila,30 Aug 2022,,False,"I do love a who dunnit where it’s absolutely impossible to figure it out as an audience member. Clues that mean absolutely nothing are crucial in these types of movies. I’m saying that as a lady who has watched every episode of Law and Order SVU twice, and therefore is good on picking up clues."
The Killing,29 Aug 2022,,False,This was like an episode of Law and Order SVU without the cops but where everything is made right in the end

The Umbrellas of Cherbourg,07 Aug 2022,★★★½,False,"Hard mids. My moms favorite movie of all time, or so she claims, but I know for a fact she has better taste than that. The color in this was so good. I need a reminder every once in a while that wallpaper is the epitome of class. However, story was boring and the reason that isn’t okay in this particular instance is that it’s a musical. It should be fun and easy to find yourself into. But it wasn’t, and the ending was sad and hollow, but not in a way that made me feel. Very whatever"
Streetwise,06 Aug 2022,,False,
Buffalo '66,05 Aug 2022,★★★★,False," This is a movie I’d imagine has an entirely different viewing experience for men and women. I can see how it’d be easy to find Layla to be a passive character, and her demeanor towards Billy is so odd, especially when you consider that you know nothing about her. My only question was, what didn’t she want to go home to? If that was answered then I could have understood her attitude. Beneath all that though, there’s this tenderness she… "
Band of Outsiders,02 Aug 2022,★★★★★,True,I mean jeez
An Affair to Remember,31 Jul 2022,★★★★★,False,Epic poggers! I do love a good cruise ship love story. Two charming people surrounded by the vast ocean with no distractions.  The ending was a little silly… but not bad. I’d just never wait 6 months to see somebody again if I really loved them.
