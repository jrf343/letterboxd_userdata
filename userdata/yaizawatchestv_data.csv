Saltburn,27 Dec 2023,,True,Wake me up when the tie-in cocktail book featuring all the fluids barry keogan injests drops
Train to Busan,20 Dec 2023,,False,Shout-out peacock for giving me the world's worst dub as the only option to watch this movie
Santa Claus,18 Dec 2023,,True,Santa claus and Merlin team up to defeat the devil who's introduced in a ballet wearing slippers. This is the best movie
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,19 Nov 2023,,True,not enough cannibalism
Last Things,07 Oct 2023,,False,
Muy Gay Too Mexicano,03 Sep 2023,★★,False,ngl during the first shot my roommate and I wondered if someone uploaded the dialogue parts of a porn video to HBOMax
Flight of the Navigator,30 Aug 2023,★★★★★,True,"I saw this DRUNK projected on the wall of a bar with Justin Timberlake playing in the background. I have no idea what the plot is, why there's like 20 minutes of dogs playing frisbee, why the kid gets abducted in a cow field, why he's weirdly calm about HAL2000 and those alien abominations, and why he parks the spaceship in the park."
How to Please a Woman,20 Aug 2023,★★,False,The international film section of Kanopy has got some absolute bangers
Jaws,15 Aug 2023,★★★★★,True,I reject reality and say that ACTUALLY Quint popped out of the water 2 minutes after the movie ended. Quint and Hooper then spend the rest of their lives traveling the ocean Legolas-and-Gimley style.
BlackBerry,08 Aug 2023,★★★,True,"I like how tactile and physical the phones are in this movie. The internet is often portrayed as something abstract as ""the cloud"" in movies (even the Social Network falls into this trap), so I appreciate any movie that gets into the nitty gritty of web servers. The annoying hum of these crappy plastic phones and the loud internet dial up sounds are such good details and make the ending so much more impactful."
Moonfall,31 Jul 2023,★,False, The first half of this movie is just so basic and boring that I almost fell asleep before we get to the gloriously stupid climax. Skip the first 30 mins of this movie trust me you will miss nothing. Random Thoughts· This movie absolutely counts as quarantine art. I can finally tap into Roland Emmerich's mind when he couldn't find toilet paper at the store. What a wonderful world we live in. · Fuzz Aldrin is a fantastic cat… 
Oppenheimer,23 Jul 2023,★★★,False, I'm going to have to see this again before I can form a solid opinion. A lot of my issues probably stem from not movie I wished for instead of the issues with the movie we got. I need to remind myself the movie is called Oppenheimer not Manhattan Project. But I still feel like this movie is a huge missed opportunity.Random Thoughts· the movie mentions uranium several times and not once mentions uranium mining within Diné reservations.…

Dune,19 May 2023,★★★★,True," ""this is such a sexy movie"" - my friend Ryan· Love a space empire movie that actually focuses on the empire of it all. So many good details. The Atreides family packing up their things to bring to Arrakis. The wasting of valuable water for hollow symbols of power. The way the Bene Gesserit use religion to wield power. · Love a movie that really attempts to smother you and make you in awe of it.· Very much… "
