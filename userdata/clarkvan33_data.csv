Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,13 Jul 2023,★★★½,False,"The ending is unexpected, chaotic, and a bit absurd - I liked that! The movie moves at a good pace for the most part, but it wound up being 20 minutes too long anyway. I liked the callbacks and the diverse set of action set pieces. Some of the characterization is clunky"

Pi,03 Jan 2023,★★½,False,"Enjoyable overall, but the heavy themes led to the plot being confusing for long stretches (on first watch, anyway). The black and white is not for me, so that docked it some points, too."

Avatar: The Way of Water,27 Dec 2022,★★,False,Visuals and action are fabulous but the story is extremely lacking and every part of the movie is far too long. Oh well

Black Adam,27 Oct 2022,★★½,False,"Ahhhh this movie is extremely odd. The tone and characterization is a little off throughout, the plot is quite confusing at times, and the movie is 20% too long. I didn't care much for the 'family moments' either. Although the flaws took me out of it sometimes, the action is quite enjoyable and I thought the 'Justice Society' was very entertaining to follow, hehe. The golden helmet guy was the best part of it all 😁. Definitely a memorable one!"
