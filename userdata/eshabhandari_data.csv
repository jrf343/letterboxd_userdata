After Everything,12 Jan 2024,★★★★★,False,i think there were some shots in here that were genuinely inspired by Kabir Singh (2019)
Dunki,31 Dec 2023,★★★★,False,ok we ALLLLLL know i am a simp for SRK but idc whatever you want to say about the plot (which wasn’t as cohesive as it could’ve been) but there is something to be said about the profound comfort he emanates in his characters…it was giving super Major Ram vibes like sab theek hoga bc SRK is there and he helps everyone and is kind and loyal and perfect. also obviously a rly great message and i can’t not commend him for that …shahrukh khan you will ALWAYS be famous my love !
Whiplash,26 Dec 2023,★,False,"“never try never fail, those are the words i live by” -that depressed orange robot from Robots (2005) also this film reminds me of when two dung beetles start squaring up with each other bc one beetle got too close to the other beetle’s pile o’ shit and in conclusion i noted at least 16.7 different personality disorders here thank u plz all men go to therapy immediately"
Wonka,19 Dec 2023,★★★,False, hmmm…well idk who needs to hear this but there’s a difference between being ✨pEcULiaR✨ and then just being kind of wired. there was like a HINT of tactile chemistry between the cast but not rly. all i could think of was everyone else being afraid of Timmy between takes lmfao. AND LASTLY LIKE the dramatic license exists for a reason and u can imagine ~prequel Willy Wonka~ however u want but isn’t he supposed to be kind of a hardened… 
Silver Linings Playbook,08 Dec 2023,★★★,False,"the greatest thing this film did for the world was legitimate mental illness as a real, inherited disease like any other (Robert DeNiro’s OCD-esque rituals —> Bradley Cooper’s Bipolar I disorder with intermittent explosive episodes) is giving genetically acquired familial disorder, probably autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance and epigenetic modification HOWEVER COMMA I DID NOT APPRECIATE THE ANTI INDIAN SENTIMENT ! CURRY SMELLS VERY GOOD I WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND THAT INSULT !"
Black Swan,08 Dec 2023,★★★★,False,add trigger warning for all virgo placements plz
Downsizing,01 Dec 2023,★½,False,Libertarian Guys With Asian Wives
Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India,01 Dec 2023,★★★★★,False, besides this bringing out every jai hind bone in my body (ok tbh there aren’t many but the ones that exist were shrieking vande mataram in C minor) i rly like how sincere this is to Indian male emotion…idk maybe this is bc this is back in the era that Bollywood was just more melodramatic in general but I’ve forgotten how emotional the men used to be in these films. i always loved that about Bollywood and this film does… 
May December,01 Dec 2023,★★★½,False,THE TEARS BEHIND THE FENCE AT GRADUATION NEARLY ENDED ME ! GIVE THIS POOR VICTIM HIS BOYHOOD BACK IMMEDIATELY ! WHY DID HIS WIFE PARENTIFY HIM SO ! I AM SAD ! also was cracking up at miss portman’s lisp impersonation but she slayed in that monologue for the most part
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,01 Dec 2023,★★★★,False,☹️ now HOW am i supposed to usher out my white boi simping era now??? on another note i have always been a little sus as to why District 12 gives severe Oklahoma vibes …is this purposeful…and if so why…i guess it’s better than giving District 12 like some sort of Slumdog Millionaire vibe lmfao
Killers of the Flower Moon,13 Nov 2023,★★★★★,False, scrap the APUSH curriculum and just have a viewing of this tbh but fOUR kwik qualms (1) do i sense…a hint of praise for the feds…ok chile anyway so (2) why was mollie in such a chokehold over this white mans. i mean fellow girlies of color who GET it like GET it but also i don’t GET it yanno? like he reeked of sus the entire time (3) bordatella pertussis is not an iconic downfall. that child deserved better…
