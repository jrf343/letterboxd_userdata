Murder on the Orient Express,15 Jan 2024,★★★★½,False,Endlessly fascinated by Albert Finney's decision to play Poirot as if he did not have a neck
Hypnotic,11 Jan 2024,★½,False," Robert Rodriguez’s total lack of shame or reservation in making genre shlock is commendable, but yeesh he used to have an original idea or two. There’s a serious question of homage vs. rote copying to be debated here, as he smashes up plot and imagery from Memento, Inception, Minority Report, The Adjustment Bureau, and Total Recall, among others, without much thought towards forming the pieces into something substantive. Ben Affleck is at his most lethargic, a million miles away at… "
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,10 Jan 2024,★★★★,False,Pretty fun. Appreciate them casting an authentic Irish actor for April O'Neil. Yuck yuck.
The Batman,08 Jan 2024,★★★★½,False,"Finally clicked with me, more than previous viewings. I love how Batman checking out Zoe Kravitz's legs is a plot point and a motif. Goofy kind of serious movie, which is the best kind."
Oppenheimer,05 Jan 2024,★★★★★,False,"Christopher Nolan has gotten Cillian Murphy to say ""Jungian"" in two different feature films."
Irma Vep,01 Jan 2024,★★★★★,False,This film may have inspired me to do the meanest thing I have ever done. Will let you know if I do it.
When Harry Met Sally...,31 Dec 2023,★★★★★,False,"""Marie, Harry's from New Jersey"""
Saltburn,30 Dec 2023,★½,False," Bro, I didn't want to get mad about this movie. I got too much going on and I was like ""just don't get mad at it, it's fine. Just be chill, dude. Don't hate. Relax, buddy. Take it easy, pal."" And so on. But I've just seen a movie designed like a psychological thriller but instead of having an increasingly twisty plot that drives you deeper into depravity and moral greyness, it shocks the viewer by becoming more shallow, more… "
The Long Goodbye,28 Dec 2023,★★★★,False," A great inversion of the hard-boiled detective story, with a fair bit of ambling in the middle. In terms of incompetent gumshoes, I admit I preferred Gene Hackman's Harry Moseby from Night Moves (1975), whose personal interiority and reasons for mediocrity are the focus of his respective film. Altman's film, by comparison, is more detached and holistic, and therefore less interested in Marlowe as a character, and more in using him as a foil against the world he inhabits. He… "
The Shop Around the Corner,27 Dec 2023,★★★★★,False,"Almost certainly the film with the most uses of the word ""Matuschek"" per minute. Also very possibly the film with the most words per minute."
Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood,27 Dec 2023,★★★★,False,Give me a minute with this one. My first time seeing it.
Doctor Who: The Church on Ruby Road,26 Dec 2023,★★★½,False,"Very light, zippy fun with a great new Doctor until it randomly becomes a half-baked It's a Wonderful Life riff for ten very strange minutes and then an old woman becomes the new main character for the last, even stranger few minutes. I'm not sure what happened here."
