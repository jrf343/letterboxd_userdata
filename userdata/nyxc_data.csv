The Fall of the House of Usher,08 Jan 2024,★★★★½,True,"doing a dive into flannigans filmography rn, this one is def more enjoyable and more refined than midnight mass."
Poor Things,07 Jan 2024,★★★★★,True," best movie of the year and it’s not even a competition.this film can be interpreted in several ways, but to me the by far the most obvious one is the infantilization of women and how it is weaponized on both a micro and macro scale. from how it starts when we are children living at home with our fathers, and later our partners, and when we dare to venture into the world independently we are systemically limited and this… "
Midnight Mass,07 Jan 2024,★★★★,True,"the whole “you fall victim to your own delusions” thing was hauntingly well done, even going so far as to show how even those who don’t subscribe to the system can and will still fall victim to it."

The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent,25 Nov 2023,★★★★,True," what a romp. what a fable. definitely a movie, of sorts. don’t think i’ve genuinely laughed like that at a film in a long ass time. FANTASTIC performances from both cage and pascal, idc if the plot was goofy - it was well written and FUN. do you have any idea how may god awful shitty caca terrible poo fart stink movies there are about making movies and how many of them i’ve had to watch???? this was one of… "
Persona,25 Nov 2023,★★★★★,True,i have too many thoughts about this right now to get any of them out eloquently but for now i’ll just leave you with i think that this is the best piece of vampire literature of all time
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,21 Nov 2023,★★,False,"to preface, it’s important to note that i have not read the book and have recently consumed a delectable concoction of migraine and sleepy time meds. that being said,"

Barbie,23 Jul 2023,★★★★½,True,"ladybird did nothing for me but barbie has bewitched me mind, body, and soul. this movie is a work of art and greta gerwig is a genius. i’m gonna go home and cry some more 💖"
