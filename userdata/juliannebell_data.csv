Two Lovers,13 Jan 2024,★★★★★,False,I’m shattered
The Cat,11 Jan 2024,,False,"my cat gives this film five stars, she was rapt the entire time. maybe she’s actually an alien?"
Good Grief,10 Jan 2024,★★★,False,honestly kinda trite but had some sweet and poignant moments
Joy Ride,08 Jan 2024,★★★★½,False,the way I took an edible and died laughing at “it’s not a bop-it it’s my asshole”
Saltburn,07 Jan 2024,★★,False," look, no one loves the idea of a homoerotic indie sleazified Brideshead Revisited/Secret History tribute more than me, but this just felt so fucking hollow and made me wish it were more like one of those stories instead. felt like what would happen if you gave a 2013 Tumblr girl a budget of millions of dollars to make the depraved movie of her dreams (except that would still probably be better than this). I couldn’t for the life of me… "
Cat People,01 Jan 2024,★★★★½,False,let's bring back men bringing women cats as a gift on their first date
The Anniversary Party,29 Dec 2023,★★★★,False,"such a fun cast! watched because I’ve recently become obsessed with Jennifer Jason Leigh thanks to her performance in the current season of Fargo (which you should watch right now if you haven’t already). I love this kind of thing, a little slice of life fly-on-the-wall party film that takes place over the course of one night and slowly reveals the nature of the relationships between the characters. kind of reminds me of The Daytrippers. lost my shit when I realized mid-movie that that little girl was Frankie Cosmos"
Bram Stoker's Dracula,28 Dec 2023,★★★★★,False,a horny gothic masterpiece. I’ve never felt more blessed to be bisexual
Friends & Family Christmas,19 Dec 2023,★★★,False,"this movie has everything the gays want—fake dating, a glove hostage exchange, photography, a Libra-Scorpio relationship, chosen family, nepo babies, ponche crema, and adorable chemistry and banter between the two leads! like Carol if it were directed by Hallmark instead of Todd Haynes. mediocre but charmingly so!! I cried!!!"
A Biltmore Christmas,17 Dec 2023,★★★★★,False,"Hallmark forgot to make this one bad. listen, this warmed my cold dead heart and made me cry and believe in love again so I have no choice but to give it five stars. also is it just me or was the kissing kinda hot…I mean, that scene where she pulled him in by the lapels? 🔥"
"Yes, Chef! Christmas",14 Dec 2023,★★,False,almost impressive how they managed to make the phrase “yes chef” unsexy
Naughty or Nice,08 Dec 2023,★½,False,we watched solely for our queen Hilarie Burton. the concept was fun enough and I was having a pretty good time watching her eviscerate all the people on the naughty list but the plot became completely incoherent once the nice list was introduced. people have a good side to them and you should give them the benefit of the doubt? boring 😴 still don’t really understand why her bf got a pass for fucking her mortal enemy??
