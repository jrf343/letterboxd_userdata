Amarcord,15 Jan 2024,★★★,False," The horniest autobiography I’ve ever seen. Tugs at fascism and village life in Italy. The music is so iconic that it’s been copied and sampled almost completely in parts of Asia, giving this film, ironically, a universal feel to it. Can tell influence on Larry David and his brand of comedy. What stands out is the makeup and casting. Hard to find such idiosyncratic looking characters that bounce around the uncanny valley, somehow both human and straight out of fantasy.… "
Sans Soleil,14 Jan 2024,★★★★½,False,The best kind of meditation. He wrote me… is my new Pavlovian mantra.
Godzilla,13 Jan 2024,★★★★,False,"For visual effects, design, look, feel, atmosphere, creature design, creature animation, creature reveals, big destruction, scale of set pieces ONLY"
Shiva Baby,13 Jan 2024,★★★,False," Rachel sennot greatly improves but we have a hard time accessing her inner thoughts at the beginning. She’s a heady actress and moments where we need to access her growing anxiety feel flat, especially when she is spotlighted by the camera. Her thought process, especially when she is about to take an action were muddled- especially in a film as subjective as this where she is our anchor, had me lost on her motivation. But she greatly improves when the… "
Irma Vep,13 Jan 2024,★★★★,False," Key ideas that left an impact;-the weight of film history and how it impacts filmmakers of each passing generation, the stress of originality on both director (as creator) and actor (as recreator). -the constant tension between reality and artifice. The struggle of adaption, juxtaposed with physical demands of production, and complexities of competing with international film market demands (co-productions etc),the eternal struggle between cultural vs commercial art and juggling the two. Vidal fails at both and is this replaced… "
Certified Copy,13 Jan 2024,★★★★½,False," Lot to say about this film but key thoughts only:- who is original and who is the copy? Are they both originals or are they both copies somehow intertwined in time-space. -who is Bincohe speaking to at which point in the film, is shimmel the husband or is he her point of admiration, or is he the source of her frustration? -genuine emotions and feigned emotions, how we present our thoughts and how we hide them, they originals or… "
Primer,13 Jan 2024,★★★,False," The leads do plenty to carry the film but despite having very different personalities didnt feel distinct- muddled perspectives, needed more time to play with the audience’s expectations of who is at fault before the story revealed itself. The techno babble was overplayed, it worked in bits and pieces and the interactions felt rhythmic and authentic but alien to anyone unfamiliar with techspeak. Desperately needed more visual aid to differentiate the two (generic white office attire for both). What worked… "
Qarib Qarib Singlle,11 Jan 2024,½,False,I really need to find a way to improve my family's appetite. Even Irrfan's charisma couldn't save this cheap trick they call entertainment.
The X Files,09 Jan 2024,★★★½,True,"Actually a pretty good thriller. Pretty terrifying from the get go, the costumes, sets and props still feel real CGI could never replicate. Does a really good job at keeping the mystery alive and giving away only tidbits for the fans to chew on. Not a film for non-fans though. "
Critical Zone,06 Jan 2024,★★★½,False," I really want to rate it higher because so much of this film feels like a lived experience to me. Hypersubjectivity reminiscent of growing up in Delhi, an analogous unnamed city craving primal desires. A Sisyphus peripatetic journey of a drug dealer over the course of a night where he both treats, therapizes and poisons his clients, a role he seems to have imposed on himself. A chapter based narrative, each chapter paying homage to an Iranian filmmaker but Kirostami… "
Superbad,02 Jan 2024,★★★★★,False," showed it to step-brother, lotta jokes went over his head lol. I love every single joke in this film, each gag one-ups the one before it. The period jeans, the boob punches, headbutt kisses, blowing up a cop car, McLovin. S: “I’m sorry, Evan, that the Coen Brothers don’t direct the p—n I watch.”F: “Chicka, chicka-yeah, fake I.D.”F: “They let you pick any name you want when you get down there."" - E: ""And you picked Mclovin?"" -… "
Dunki,31 Dec 2023,★★,False," SRK and Raju Hirani are now essentially part of the propaganda machine- they know their role in society at large. It pains me because SRK has so much cross-cultural charisma- he is an icon for SA people everywhere. To see him in this “so-called” cautionary tale on immigration outside India is disheartening, subliminal anti-Muslims messaging, and very Bharat-coded. I’ve yet to come across another country that infantilizes its audience and uses film as a medium to sway opinions as much… "
