Oppenheimer,21 Jul 2023,★★★★½,False," I think this is a great mix of things I personally loveGrand, dramatic films with huge amounts of dialogueScientific and historical World War II and the morality of Atomic Bombs and scientific advancement This was a treat to watch in IMAX, especially those insert shots of particles flowing through the screen.Cillian does an amazing job as Oppenheimer, just like RDJ does a good job with Strauss (although that side narrative was definitely on the weaker side)There are… "

Song of the Sea,14 Jul 2023,★★★★,False,I deeply regret not taking my art history teacher’s recommendation on watching the book of Kels this animation is BEAUTIFUL. Also watching this while in Ireland made this so much more special. I would recommend this for all ages it’s really good.
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,07 Jun 2023,★★★★½,False,The animation is still unmatched while still improving itself by showing the variety of different styles through each of its character's universes (Gwen's watercolor/pastel world is gorgeous).
Missing,27 May 2023,★★★½,False,I can't believe the TikTok voice follows me even in movies.
Suzume,14 Apr 2023,★★★½,False,"A step up from weathering with you in terms of story (which was mostly a let down for me because of the ending, which this one wraps up decently well) but a slight let down in terms of visuals. This is still a Makoto Shinkai visual fest, but it doesn't compare to your name and weathering with you on that level. The road trip section was fantastic with the small list of city pop playing in the car :)"
