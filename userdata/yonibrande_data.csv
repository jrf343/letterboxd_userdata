The Hill,12 Jan 2024,,False,some old white lady was watching this on my flight just now in front of me. feel-good christian fascist schlock with a veneer of a baseball flick. fun to watch a kid hit dingers tho
Top Gun: Maverick,05 Jan 2024,,True,watched on a flight in severe turbulence and got so much more out of the experience I didn't even care that the delta earbuds were like listening through mud
Godzilla,29 Dec 2023,,True,"I hadn't seen this in a very long time, and rewatching it as an adult with some level of media literacy, it's interesting how a commentary on nuclear proliferation and collective responsibility kicked off decades of goofy monster flicks. double featuring this and Oppenheimer would be fun."
White Christmas,26 Dec 2023,,True,"this was wonderful, and I feel obligated to note that the only reason Danny Kaye was able to make this movie is that he fumbled my grandma, who married a different new york yid actor who served in an armored division in Italy during the war aka my grandpa paul"

Sexual Drive,20 Dec 2023,½,False,tapped out after 30 minutes of food themed sexual assault
The Killer,11 Dec 2023,,True,my dad walked in during this and just stood directly in front of the TV watching for 20 minutes while the entire Florida chapter happened
Scott Pilgrim Takes Off,29 Nov 2023,,True,"this was fun in a way I don't think I was expecting. I'm not going to pretend it's super deep or anything but it's a cute exploration of the characters. good fights, good dialogue, cheesy in a good way"
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,26 Nov 2023,,True,I think it would be incredibly sad to admit I learned some sort of lesson from this movie to apply in my own relationships so instead I'll say I learned I want to punch jason schwartzman in his smug little mouth
Past Lives,18 Nov 2023,,True,watched this on a plane so I wouldn't cry
