Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,03 Sep 2023,★★★★,True,One of the best Marvel movies I've seen in a long time but I feel like this should be rated R just for the emotional trauma lol. Sorry Mark and Julia for crying all over you on the plane multiple times :///

Edge of Tomorrow,27 Apr 2023,★★★½,True,Great flick but that ending had me laughing for a good minute. Why did they cut it so abruptly haha

John Wick,25 Mar 2023,★★,False,
American Gangster,16 Mar 2023,★★★,True,"Denzel is MY MAN hahaha get it?! He really was the highlight of this for me though. Awesome, star studded cast and a great sense of atmosphere. My main qualm was that I didn't feel as invested in Russell Crowe's character until his story began to intertwine with Frank's. "

Sound of Metal,15 Jan 2023,★★★½,True,"A movie about change and how quickly the course of someone's life can be altered. Amazing, immersive sound design and great performances. I was itching to see more of what Ruben ended up doing music-wise especially with the foreshadowing some scenes seemed to lean into. Instead, Sound of Metal leaves things more open-ended which I still thought was a fitting end but left me wanting even more. Maybe it's just my bias as a musician haha. Would love to give Rubie a big ol HUG!"

Aftersun,02 Jan 2023,½,False,"2 hours of shots of the ocean, paragliders, and a kid singing karaoke."
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",01 Jan 2023,★½,False,
Boiling Point,31 Dec 2022,★★★★,True,"The one shot format really works well for Boiling Point, providing a sense of atmosphere that I don't think would be accomplished otherwise. Every performance in this is exceptional and had me equally invested in all of the different members of the restaraunt team."

Minding the Gap,27 Dec 2022,★★★★,True,"Minding the Gap tells a story of generational trauma and escapism. What really brings this documentary to life though, is the direction of Bing Liu. With a combination of hard hitting, upfront questions and a willingness to peel back the layers of his own life, Bing comes across something truly unique. With an exceptionally emotional and vulnerable last 20 or so minutes, Minding the Gap is an essential watch that may hopefully bring about much needed conversations and reflection in households similar to those of the 3 boys."
