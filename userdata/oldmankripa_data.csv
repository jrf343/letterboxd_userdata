Wonka,30 Dec 2023,,True,"paul king... MY man!! as expected, delightful and magical worldbuilding. such amazing setpieces, edited so precisely. also love that i saw this salve straight after recovering from crying at the iron claw. the iron clonka :) "
The Iron Claw,30 Dec 2023,,True,"oh, stunning!! some amazing directorial choices. love a melodrama that features some of the worst hair i've ever seen in my life. zac efron is SO good at carrying and wearing exhaustion over the runtime of this film... the way he plays the gradual but relentless weathering of his character is really notable. and in such contrast to the other brothers who are all great too."
Carol,24 Dec 2023,★★★★★,True,"my favorite movie in the world <3 <3 <3 first time watching it in 35mm and boy did every element of it sing. just oozes beauty, yearning, wistfulness, dignity, delicateness, subtext in a way i've never really experienced."
All of Us Strangers,22 Dec 2023,,True," luminous, stunning, so compassionate.... i want to try this real love thing sometime, even if just for a moment :(the film has a v specific sense of place that i wasn't expecting, which resonated big time. the turns between score, soundtrack, and silence felt so effective in maintaining this mood. the fantastical, time-warping parent/child dynamics must have been so fun to write and perform... jamie bell mvp. this andrew scott (and haigh, for that matter) knows what he's doing… "

Napoleon,05 Dec 2023,,False,"wish ridley was a fan of hulu's the great...if this movie stayed content as a devilish little mind game between lil freak boss baby husband and cunning, 4 steps ahead, ethereal, mindblowingly beautiful wife, i'd be a happy gal (i'm not)"
May December,04 Dec 2023,,True,mother-off left us gut-wrenched :( need these 2 to team up with cate blanchett // judi dench. it's been sitting in my head like no other. had MANY thoughts about the depiction and role of the kids in this chess game too.
