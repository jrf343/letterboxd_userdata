The Iron Claw,13 Jan 2024,★★★★,False,"Long-time Zac Efron stan here. No, I don’t know what happened to his face, but it kinda works for this movie. He literally embodies the macabre vibe that dominates the film, with little relief provided by brief moments of tenderness and pure fantasy. I was amazed by the story Durkin drew out of one of those evangelical death-traps we call “families” in this country. Horribly sad and disturbingly familiar. Incredible acting from all sides. So good even Jacob cried."
Maestro,04 Jan 2024,★★★★,False,"My grandma hated this as a “real chainsmoker” who couldn’t look past Bradley Cooper’s impersonation of a cigarette addict, or his generally hammy portrayal of Bernstein. But, as you can imagine, all the music featured absolutely killed. Carey Mulligan is incredible. I’m not a hater— I got invested. Definitely watch on a big screen if possible, I can imagine a lot of the magic being lost on a laptop."
BlackBerry,03 Jan 2024,★★★★,False,Lots of good product design easter eggs for those who partake. Big Short x Social Network with even weirder-looking dudes so get watching girlies!
The Boys in the Boat,30 Dec 2023,★★★★★,False,Fuck you Hitler we put boys in a boat!!
Past Lives,29 Dec 2023,★★★½,False," Overall extremely moving and, in the words of my mother, “beautiful to look at.” I loved the focus on Nora/Na Young’s desires outside of love despite the love story theme, and thought the performances were incredible all around. Would have liked more character and world-building— I didn’t feel particularly invested in the story aside from knowing that I should be because I sat down to watch the movie. I’m thinking that the simplicity of the characters and the length of… "

Crimes of the Future,29 Nov 2023,★,False,I’m a good sport but this was NOT it. Highly entertaining tho.
Spy,25 Nov 2023,★★★½,False,"Melissa, I love you."
Anatomy of a Fall,18 Nov 2023,★★★★½,False,"Stunner. I didn’t notice that 2.5 hours had passed until we emerged from the theater into the dark dark night. Truly an outstanding film with terrific writing and performances all around. Toys with the audience the entire time, dragging or firing you into different perspectives before you know what to do with what you just saw. And the Grenoble prosecutor’s rabid pursuit of “justice”…. too good!"
eXistenZ,11 Nov 2023,★★★★½,False,"Came back for more Crone and what a reward. Toes the funny scary sexy grotesque line sooo perfectly. Once again struck by the impeccable set and prop design, as well as the uncanny feeling that I might still be in the game…"
