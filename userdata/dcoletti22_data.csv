The Parallax View,16 Jan 2024,,True,I watched this movie at 3 am and I will surely be unable to fly out of the country after this review but goddamn did this movie make political assassination look dope as fuck
Eyes Wide Shut,11 Jan 2024,,False,This movie just reinforced the idea that everyone else in society is fucking a lot more than I am I guess
Beautiful Boy,11 Jan 2024,★★★★,True," For a movie that I am giving 4 stars, I find myself extremely conflicted about my feelings toward it. I found both main characters' struggles and emotions extremely compelling, which I think is more owed to Chalamet and Carell's performances and chemistry rather than the dialogue, yet I felt like I was left wanting a lot more out of their combined struggle. I get that the movie aims to show the inescapability of addiction from the perspective of the user… "
Napoleon,10 Jan 2024,★★★,True," While I enjoyed watching Napoleon, I was almost immediately and constantly annoyed with the muddled tone and goal of the film. It both wanted to be a massive war movie and a complex biopic about Napoleon, but it never feels like these two elements mesh. To be clear, Ridley Scott is a master at orchestrating massive, authentic historical battles and it was on full display in Napoleon. I think the issue lie with the way they depicted Napoleon; stuck between… "
Colossal,10 Jan 2024,,False,
Law Abiding Citizen,08 Jan 2024,,False,When I was 10 years old I thought this movie was really fucking good
Geostorm,08 Jan 2024,,False,"Totally forgot this movie existed for obvious reasons, but goddamn do I love that Gerard Butler keeps grinding out slightly different disaster movies every year simply for the bread"
American Sniper,08 Jan 2024,★★★,False," Lots about this movie people do not like specifically about the light in which all of the killings are viewed in. This a fair criticism for sure, but the movie is called American Sniper, anyone who expected this to show the duality of war in the Middle East probably shouldn’t have. That being said, I also would say other movies have shown the effects of war soley through American soldiers POV way better than this movie (Jarhead, if you were… "
Gran Torino,08 Jan 2024,★★★½,False,"I know that Eastwood is a decisive director due to his political beliefs, but he does a pretty damn good job in this movie merging a lot of different worlds. The plot isn’t exactly the move novel, but it’s definitely original enough of a take that it works well. Also, his line delivery is pretty fucking awesome in this movie and definitely makes it really watchable. I think the real blind spot for Eastwood is that he rarely evaluates any part of society solely through class, which probably would’ve made this movie a lot deeper and meaningful."
J. Edgar,08 Jan 2024,★★★,False," I think this movie gets a lot of criticism for a few things that aren’t entirely fair. First, I think Hoover as a historical figure is heavily disliked for obvious and deserved reasons, and that Eastwood is known as a right wing director who slants things towards his political view. Neither of these are really fair criticism for this movie in my opinion. This movie does a pretty classic job as a biopic, setting a historically based narrative for the… "
Oldboy,05 Jan 2024,★★★★★,True,
Incendies,05 Jan 2024,★★★★,True," Prior to watching this film, I had realized I had not only seen most of Denis’s work but also truly enjoyed nearly all of them. Thus this movie has been on my watchlist for quite some time.This movie has all of the core elements that make his films so appealing: complex and very realistic characters, a uniquely gripping plot, but mostly innovative ways to fuck with the human psyche. For his 3rd feature film too, Denis really let it… "
American Fiction,04 Jan 2024,★★★★½,True," “People are better than their worst deeds”This movie really wowed me with its extremely well balanced tone and depth of every character; but it was the way that every character was explored, revealed and developed that really made this movie for me. The characters feel incredibly real both in their role in the movie but more importantly their relationships and communication with one another. This movie is a rare example (or it at least feels like this) where the… "
