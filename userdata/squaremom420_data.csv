Asteroid City,26 Jun 2023,★★★★,False,anderson’s style is taken up to 11 here - loved the very unreal look of the set design and the black and white meta narrative sequences. Definitely inward looking though I would argue some parts felt deliberately obtuse rather than offering meaningful commentary
