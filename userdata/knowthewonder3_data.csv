American Fiction,31 Dec 2023,★★★½,False," More of a family drama / character study than a satire in the style of “The Producers” or “Bamboozled.” The first trailer for this is pretty misleading—it is a comedy with many laugh-out-loud lines, but it has a deep undertow of melancholy. Which is ironic, because the movie marketers make the movie seem “about race” when the characters bristle at that very idea.Often the movie feels divided between the family drama and the literary satire, but excels when dealing… "
The Holdovers,14 Nov 2023,★★★★,True,"A really lovely mix of acerbic/biting dialogue and sweet, quiet moments of connection. You can probably guess some of the characters arcs going in but the actors still make you care really deeply about them."
NYAD,07 Nov 2023,★★½,False," This is supposed to be a character study about a stubborn, flawed, extraordinary woman. I just don’t know if it goes far enough into exploring how much of a capitalist Nyad is—how she’s literally destroying her body and other peoples’ lives not just for glory, but for commercial gain. She’s swimming for a story that she’ll be able to sell to Oprah, to the press, to book publishers, to movie executives, to us. Nyad too often feels like a product… "
Priscilla,04 Nov 2023,★★★½,True," Now I’m probably biased to liking this because I really enjoy chamber pieces / two person plays / gothic stories. Priscilla definitely feels like one (her isolating, claustrophobic work on The Beguiled truly helps this film achieve its tone).I had a good time with this one though. Its feelings of repetition and isolation, although probably in part due to the film’s small budget, feel weaponized here. It’s a lovely, American gilded cage.Like Marie Antoinette, there are lots of… "
Killers of the Flower Moon,20 Oct 2023,★★★★½,True," Knocked down a half-star because it really could’ve spent like 30 more minutes exploring the Osage people during this time (LONGER I say!).But this is a pretty staggering achievement, I don’t know how many more films Scorsese wants to make but I will watch them all.Sections of this reminded me of the divisive Broadway show “Slave Play.” Interracial couples are near allegories, representing disturbing American politics via disturbing toxic relationships. But both the play and now “Killers of… "
Theater Camp,18 Sep 2023,★★½,False,"It’s cute and silly. For a more absurd version, just watch CAMP. Despite everything, I feel like “John Mulaney & the Sack Lunch Bunch” remains the golden standard of this style of humor. It made me want to rewatch THAT show"
Bottoms,07 Sep 2023,★★★★,True,Gay culture at its finest… give them all bigger budget projects
Barbie,21 Jul 2023,,True," Greta Gerwig has always made films about theatrical people. Frances Halladay is a dancer whose choreography often just creates slapstick. Christine “Lady Bird” McPherson brings a “theatrical flair” to mundane high school life, to the reluctant admiration of her family. Jo March performs plays for rapt children, and later transforms painful memories into fiction through her wit and verve. It’s only in Barbie, Gerwig’s latest feature (and a pop culture phenomenon from the promotional tour alone), that Gerwig surpasses making… "
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,17 Jun 2023,★★★,False,"It was alright. The movie essentially has TWO first acts for two different protagonists, and the entire third act felt like it was about to cut to the cliffhanger. "
Past Lives,17 Jun 2023,★★★★,True,"There’s something very simple about the story—some might say elemental, some might say rote. Part of me wonders if Celine Song should’ve expanded the plot past its premise. But part of the movie’s message is about not being able to get past the premise of your own existence—that your life is a story planned out for you, and you’re just on a track living it. There’s something haunting about that, and the “choices” you’re forced to make. "
Howard,20 May 2023,★★★,True,Disney making this film disappear while they’re generating MILLIONS of dollars off Ashman’s songs feels so wrong.
First Cow,09 Apr 2023,★★★★,False,"If you can get on its wavelength, there are so many rewards in this sometimes achingly gentle, sometimes quietly harrowing film. "
