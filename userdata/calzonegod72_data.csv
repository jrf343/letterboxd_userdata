E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,28 Dec 2023,â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…,True, Unquestionably one of my favorite movies ever. The best kids movie I have ever seen. The best kids on bikes movie (yes I think I love it even more than the Goonies). I cannot overstate how much I love this movie. I wanted to burst into tears so many times throughout it (both bike-flying scenes and the goodbyes) and I finally couldn't stop myself when they both said ouch ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­We watched it in the den in Grandma's apartment -â€¦

It Comes at Night,11 Dec 2023,,False,best part was at night when it came
The Blood on Satan's Claw,03 Dec 2023,,True," I really fucked with this. Initially, perhaps one of my only criticisms was me feeling a bit underwhelmed when it ended immediately after the lord vanquished the devil (although it was nice that whatWasHisName - reed? - farmer boy from opening scene) was saved. But it was undeniably a very cool scene to me. The more I thought about it, it really it wasn't a bad place to end it, because everything after that would not be nearly as hype.â€¦ "
The Hills Have Eyes,30 Nov 2023,â˜…â˜…Â½,False,"Honestly a little bit mid. Beast was a frickin' beast though, taking out two of the hill-people. I'm not at all disappointed that I watched it; I wouldn't say I thought it was bad at all, just a pretty thoroughly average experience for me. Pretty solidly entertaining."
