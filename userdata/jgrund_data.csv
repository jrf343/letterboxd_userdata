Party Girl,17 Dec 2023,★★★★,False,"watched w le on a sleepy night. loved the outfits and aura, loved the snappy dialogue but was often confused by the storybook plot. maybe that’s the point. fairytale set in post factory new york. parkey posey proves again and again that she can carry a comedy to its ecstatic end. would recommend for when you’re feeling like watching a movie."
Bama Rush,11 Jun 2023,★,False,how do i get recruited to be in the machine
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,11 Jun 2023,★★★★½,False,"primo movie watching experience. saw w kurt at williamsburg cinemas felt like high school sneaking into a movie w sodypop and pop corn laughing and tearing up. despite there being 100 spider-man movies i’m still compelled, cuz he’s just a guy tryna do good yknow? tryna have it all, tryna be a kid, tryna show off, tryna save the world. and who isn’t? action was clever and dynamic, humor was subtle and stupid (chaotic good), and emotion was succinct, if a bit overplayed sometimes. go with friends. movies are back."
Moonstruck,16 May 2022,,False," charming over the top romantic goofy sweaty and i want it all. needed to watch a sweet nyc movie so i watched a damn sweet nyc movie. who’s to say what love is? who’s to say what family is? maybe more than the content the actual endearing quality the whole cast brought to this strange storybook movie won me over. also something about hands, texture, clothing,  gesture as a mode of articulation was so beautiful to watch. like nic cages… "
Licorice Pizza,09 May 2022,,False,"watched on airplane with engine sounds roaring . pretty sweet, pretty fun, pretty silly. could feel the heat, could smell the plastic. was it racist? eh. we’re people laughing at the funny accent? probably. sad. felt like a celebration lap on ptas part, like he had nothing to prove and was having a lot of fun. sometimes felt stilted, shaking structure atop skinny timber of characters. but it never fell! maybe i’ll watch again in a more real way."
The Batman,14 Mar 2022,★★★½,False,bats cats rats and swats. good shots poor dialogue
The Worst Person in the World,13 Feb 2022,★★★,False," watched w leah at angelika—sat in rain sad after. something missing here that i couldn’t  express for a while. something not found in the searching, in the chaos of triers observation. i couldn’t tell at first, but the movie is empty of real empathy for any of the characters. so much so that they only felt like caricatures, and never people, and that the actors felt more true than the movie itself. it was cartoonish in  it’s exposition and characterizations,… "
Spider-Man: No Way Home,13 Jan 2022,,False,"watched at stuart cinema w a angsty acne ridden teen at the front of house which felt right. brought me back to going to movies as a kid. not caring what the movie was really. messy headspace, so much quip and forced realness, but hey enjoyable spider-man movie. what are you gonna do with 275 mil? prob make a spider man movie. such is life. i like toby and willem and alfred, wanna see them in a normal movie."
The Color of Pomegranates,09 Jan 2022,★★★★½,False,yea! love set design history poetry sequence building abstraction tacking in characters and painting and animal and myth. love chanting vibrating emulsifying the chaos of war and tragedy and faith.
The Lost Daughter,09 Jan 2022,★★★½,False,"watched w l and wish i had read the book. shot like a horror movie, so much focus on bodies and how beautiful and ugly they are and how that line blurs. mania of motherhood, helplessness and weakness and autonomy of men. felt like something..was missing tho…"
Don't Look Up,26 Dec 2021,★★,False,the equivalent of reading an op ed from liberal media except if the op ed cost 75 million to make. i’ve said it before and i’ll say it again—stop. making. movies!
