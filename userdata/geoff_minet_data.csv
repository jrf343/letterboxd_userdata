"Hail, Caesar!",23 Sep 2023,★★★½,True,
Talk to Me,14 Sep 2023,★★★,True," “Talk to me” at its core is about vulnerability. The demon world is at its strongest when it attaches to a vulnerable host, and when it can use those vulnerabilities to wreak havoc. Though it presents a demonic, fantasy realm, this movie feels real and more relatable than some other horror movies. This movie presents the allure of seeing reality differently than you normally do. The hand that possesses the characters is almost like a drug, taking these characters to… "

Sinister,11 Aug 2023,,True,"I feel like this movie has a proportionately high amount of heart-thumping scenes. Rarely does it keep its foot off of the gas, and it does not take very long at all to feel possessed by its world. "
They Live by Night,01 Aug 2023,★★★★,True," A classic noir story of doomed fate, impossible love, and a seedy world that our characters will try to overcome. What stands out about this world is the naïveté and general good-heartedness of the male and female protagonists—no femme fatale (at least for the protagonist..) here—and Ray’s distinct style. Stylistically what stood out to me were the number of shots where one character is positioned in the foreground looking above or to the side of the camera, and the person… "
Barbie,27 Jul 2023,★★★½,True," “Barbie” is witty, extremely fun, and dreamily intoxicating in its best moments. Its plot is nothing new—at times it is reminiscent of “Truman Show”, “Elf” (with, fittingly, Will Ferrel), and “Don’t Worry Darling” (unfortunately) to name a few—but it is unique in its style that is Greta’s own. My favorite moments of Barbie came from the jabby conversations between characters. When Barbie meets “weird Barbie” for the first time, Ken’s ongoing attempts to attract Barbie, and the Ken rivalry that… "

Yet the mob (his uncle is the mobioso) preaches protecting oneself first; they preach saving one’s own skin and letting weak relations “go”. In Mean Streets, Charlie is put to the test—and the test is what can he do about his unhinged, irresponsible friend Johnny Boy (Robert DeNiro)?First off, this movie has unforgettable characters and unforgettable scenes.

Also, though some of these moments hit big, at times I couldn't get past what I… "
