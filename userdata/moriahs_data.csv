Oldboy,15 Jan 2024,★★★½,False,I would never open a box wrapped in that unsightly purple wrapping paper.
Downhill Racer,14 Jan 2024,★★★½,False,Maybe the most beautiful sports movie?? Stunning. And filmed ON LOCATION. IN EUROPE. A few more highlights:
John Wick: Chapter 2,14 Jan 2024,,False,
Parasite,13 Jan 2024,★★★★½,False,"Between Parasite and Justin Bieber, it’s been a wild PR decade for peaches."
John Wick,13 Jan 2024,★★★★½,False,"If I were a criminal, I too would conduct my business behind a Peter Luger’s. "
Paper Moon,12 Jan 2024,★★★★,False,"It’s a movie of bittersweet imbalances that equal out to something charming. The tone perfectly captures a half-smile, half-full-crescent world with a kid who had to grow up a little too early, and a man who is resisting adult responsibility. Probably my favorite Bogdanovich."
The Lobster,12 Jan 2024,★★★½,False,If your aunts who ask why you’re still single opened a White Lotus… this is what it would be like.

That Darn Cat!,10 Jan 2024,★★★★½,False," I was raised on this movie. I'm pretty sure it taught me the word ""darn,"" so I have that to thank it for. Here's a list of other perks:- A titular theme song by Bobby Darin - Referring to a dumb boyfriend as ""flypaper."" The boyfriend is also named ""Canoe,"" like as his actual name. - While were on Canoe, he also wears a fake mustache and gets stuck in a garage door, which is premium content. - ED… "
Blackhat,10 Jan 2024,★★★½,False,"""Is that tangible enough for you?"""
Speed,09 Jan 2024,★★★★½,False,Amazing how well this holds up after 30 years. The practical stunts and the masterful direction of Jan de Bont keep you so glued to the screen you barely notice some unfortunate scripting.
Shiva Baby,08 Jan 2024,,False,
Marnie,08 Jan 2024,★★★½,False," I love feeling the suspense of Hitchcock films. I think I hate how I feel when I watch Marnie.Though I suppose that is an accomplishment in some way. It’s just too close to home on all sides—Tippie, Hitchcock, and even me. Hitchcock spoke often about intentionally making the audience participants in his films. I definitely found myself in this one, wanting to get out.There is something in this that breaks the “art vs artist” debate. The two are… "
