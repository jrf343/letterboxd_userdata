The Iron Claw,13 Jan 2024,★★★★,True," Not bad for a quasi biopic! Excluding the wrestling sequences, jaw-dropping musculature , and choreography, the performances were impressive. Including all the physical elements, the performances were unbelievable! The slams, the bams, the booms, the slaps. Fucked. So sick. Alsooooo, I really appreciated how Efron's hulking physique isn't glamorized or sexualized. His ridiculous transformation serves a legitimate dramatic purpose. As a reflection of the intensely restricted, repressed, and regimented upbringing, his body is as much a symbol of his victimization… "
Bend It Like Beckham,04 Jan 2024,★★★★★,True,PURE FLAMES WTF
The Boys in the Boat,30 Dec 2023,★★★★★,True,God I love this shit
Past Lives,30 Dec 2023,★★½,False,"I found almost nothing about this movie memorable. All dialogue and the dialogue sucks. (“It’s just so crazy that this boy I knew as a kid is now a man, and he’s here! He’s so Korean-Korean, whereas I, by contrast, am Korean-American.”) It was cool to see the husband character get cuck-ed so hard, though — not that the film gave us any real reason to believe their relationship, or any relationship in the whole movie, was worth fighting for."
Gangs of New York,27 Dec 2023,★★,False, *Real-time reflections on Martin Scorsese’s Gangs of New York*Does his hat keep getting taller? “You got the sand?”Seriously what‘s up with these hats?Whose idea was this? It’s not abundantly clear why “the blood stays on the blade”Didn’t exactly realize this was wet-face-big-mustache DDLThis could be the dumbest movie ever made. I’m digging it. U2 song at the end???? U2 song confirmed.***APPENDIX***Turns out a staggering amount of the Gangs hijinks actually took place lmaoWilliam…

X2,23 Dec 2023,★★★½,True,Littttttttle long
X-Men,23 Dec 2023,★★★★★,True,Perfect film
A Quiet Place,15 Dec 2023,★★½,False," I don't think it is worth the effort to list the many problems I had with this mostly dumb movie, but I will take the time to say the following: (i) Making absolutely zero attempts to communicate how a legion of blind Alien-like aliens ended up on Earth is lazy and fucked up;(ii) Limiting narrative exposition of the whole 'how this random dumb shit happened to Earth' to a few 8""x12"" white boards you can see in the background… "
A Fistful of Dollars,10 Dec 2023,★★★★,True,"The scene when Clint tells the Baxter boys to apologize to his mule because the mule, unlike him, The Man With No Name, didn’t understand that the Baxter boys were just playing around when they fired all those shots at the mule’s feet and then Clint stares ‘em down and shoots the shit out of them (ooh oooh ooh right after he told the coffin maker — the only man with steady work in town! — to “get three coffins ready” on his way over to shoot em up) was so cool."
