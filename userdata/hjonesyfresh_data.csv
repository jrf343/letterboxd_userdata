Tony Hawk: Until the Wheels Fall Off,10 May 2022,★★★★★,True,Completely legendary and inspiring. What would tony do ?
The Little Things,01 May 2022,★★★★,True,I thought it was fun albeit bland. 4 stars for this quirky cast. Reminded of me of holes
Spider-Man: No Way Home,04 Jan 2022,★★★★★,True," the year is 2022 and i watched this film alone after getting a negative covid test on the upper east side. the lines are shorter up there. there's also a dope chik fil a next to the theater. oh right the spider man movie. one of the finest films i can remember seeing in person over the past few years. first of all, the fight choreography was awesome, like WWE or capaoiera. action was all quick and easy to follow.… "
A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night,02 Jan 2022,★★★,False," the camera work and vibe was awesome, i loved the look of it. bad city just felt cursed and yet i was in love with queen vamp. awesome. now for the harsh critique, just a hair too slow. i dont like dozing off to movies, my dad does it and my ex lady friend did the same. lo and behold... this movie ends and im dozin like a mofo thats frozen. mom and cat are scrolling on they're cellies. imagine… "
Me To Play,21 Feb 2021,★★★★★,True," My dad, Chris, is a star so I’m biased but this is my new favorite doc . Hats off to Jim Dan and all the rest of who worked on this. The Original performance on stage was the best piece of theater I have ever seen (back in 2012). My dads whole mood has improved since this came out. He said he feels like he has a legacy . He said Meryl Streep saw it and loved it. You have… "
[REC],06 Aug 2020,★★★★★,True,i try not to throw 5's around lightly but this is the best shaky cam/found footage movie of all time. this shit is like 28 days later meets nightcrawler meets your local vlogger. 
Mandy,05 Aug 2020,★★½,True,"if u spliced together the 7 minutes of outrageous cageisms and found a way to make the entire film as fun, hardcore, and silly, it would be an easy 5 stars but he can only do so much. the first hour was dreadfully slow and dare i say lifeless. kooky vibes alone arent enough to save ya from a weakass misogynistic get your revenge plot lemme tell ya. maybe im not big brain or metal enough to feel this one on a deeper level :P"
The Wailing,05 Aug 2020,★★★★★,True," most of the movies that run this long end with me thinking ""damn they could have trimmed some of the fat in act 3"" but i can honestly say i wanted more. i tried to predict plot points and twists about a dozen times until, with 20 minutes left, i gave up and accepted the craziness for what it was. this movie had a slow burn turned 0 to 100 vibe that switched genres on a dime. comedy, thriller, mystery,… "
