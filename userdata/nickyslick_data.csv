Songs from the Second Floor,15 Jan 2024,,False,"Really well done. But I don't have that much of a tolerance for this kind of vaguely torturous, ceaselessly grim movie anymore. Not that it doesn't have its humor, but idk I just find it a bit too depressing or something. Maybe the coldness is comparable to The Shining, a film I have a similar issue with. So, not bad and well done, but I didn't like it."
La Chimera,10 Jan 2024,,False," I saw this in Italian, so I maybe missed 20% of the dialogue, give or take, though I don't think I missed anything important and it isn't a dialogue heavy movie. It left me pretty indifferent, though I liked it more than Rohrwacher's last film (Lazzaro whatever it was). I respect that she has her own style and she is more interesting than a lot of contemporary filmmakers. I guess I just can't really connect with her style... Idk, nothing… "
The French Connection,09 Jan 2024,,False," I think this is only really worth it because of the central chase scene, which was really great. Otherwise it is good and relatively engaging, though not necessarily amazing. The camera work was also very impressive and added a lot to the tenser scenes. Ending was surprising and made me like the whole movie a lot more in retrospect, though not necessarily enough to watch it again. Also, I hate Roy Scheider's face a lot. It just unnerves and annoys… "
Crumb,30 Dec 2023,,True,"Despite it all, R. Crumb has ""rizz."""
8½,28 Dec 2023,★★★★★,True," I forgot how much of this movie is the screenwriter character just describing and criticizing pretty much every scene that follows. Fellini's response is therefore essentially ""yeah these are all valid criticisms but fuck you I'm gonna do it anyway."" This acknowledgement without justification is very admirable and part of me wonders if it is too uncommon these days in art. If all you do is critique you can never create. This is why no matter how much I agree… "
Naked,26 Dec 2023,,True,"Really impressed by this. While it is a disturbing and alienating film, there are real glimpses of humanity, too. Even Johnny, who is established as a rapist before the credits, is still somehow sympathetic and even kind at moments. The whole Sebastian arc was bizarre and I don't entirely understand it- but I suppose he serves to make Johnny appear less evil in comparison (maybe?). Also I kind of want to cop Johnny's fit. That trench coat looks smooth!"
The Dead,26 Dec 2023,,True," Really great and faithful adaptation that also meaningfully adds to the original text (which is probably the best short story ever written in English in my opinion). Joyce is a god, but Huston is a more-than-worthy disciple. This is the best Christmas movie...though certainly not the most uplifting. In a way, though, the sadness and melancholy over our humanity and mortality is the unspoken but always present backdrop to every holiday gathering, probably Christmas more than any other. So for… "
Heat,24 Dec 2023,,True,"Great movie, captures how I feel as a deranged academic man in a dying field. Made my father watch this with me and he didn't seem all that impressed- said it was ""good"" and refused to elaborate other than ask me what actors played all the minor characters."
The Muppet Christmas Carol,22 Dec 2023,,True,"Marley and Marley song goes hard. Hadn't thought about this movie in years, holds up. The ghost of Christmas past is fucked up though why is she not even a Muppet"
