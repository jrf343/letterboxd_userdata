All of Us Strangers,15 Jan 2024,★★★★½,False," Normally I roll my eyes at white queer movies. In some ways this is white people’s Moonlight. Alas, the entire theater was silently crying throughout this movie. Can you really ever go home again? What does it mean? What is closure? Is it something we make up. Is it something that must be sought out purposefully, relentless. One of the many scenes I am stuck on is when Adam says “I dreamt a whole life of things we would do… "
Role Play,15 Jan 2024,★★½,False,Kaley Cuoco is incredible. Everything else about this is decidedly not. Equal parts predictable and incoherent. A fun weekend watch at the very least
The Mummy Returns,14 Jan 2024,,False,
The Mummy,14 Jan 2024,,False,I love these movies. The nostalgia of it all
My Policeman,04 Jan 2024,★★★,False,"Everyone’s a little gay, right? Please no more Harry Styles ❤️"
The Color Purple,03 Jan 2024,★★★★½,False,If you say anything bad about this movie you’re anti-Black. 
Poor Things,02 Jan 2024,★★★★½,False,"Writing a review because I keep thinking about this film. Bizarre, otherworldly, transcendent. I love Emma Stone in these roles. I don’t think I’ve seen a more thoughtful provoking film recently with so much to say and that says it so well. A film about power who has it, why they have it, and when."
House of Gucci,02 Jan 2024,★★★,False,A beautiful nothing.
TÁR,30 Dec 2023,,False,
The Imitation Game,30 Dec 2023,★★★★,False,"Nazis bad, homophobia bad. Benedict Cumberbatch as the tortured (autistic?) genius Alan Turning good, Keira Knightley incredible (as always)."
La La Land,28 Dec 2023,★★★★,False,I have tried to watch this film so many times and have just now finished it. Remember when this almost won best picture. I for one think we need to stop the movie musical phenomenon

May December,22 Dec 2023,★★★★★,True," As a rule I hate the whole Hollywood-meta-art-looking-at-itself shtick, but this!!!!!! Haynes did something with this!!!!!!!!! So many thoughts oh where to begin. FIRST! My god the details in this movie! The imagery! The butterflies! Caged as caterpillars, then released when they’ve metamorphosed. The idea of caging beautiful things. I mean the fact they had the butterfly appear on graduation! Gracie BEING A LITERAL HUNTER! Her seeing the fox! I MEAN MY GOD! Also, the fact that website doesn’t list… "
