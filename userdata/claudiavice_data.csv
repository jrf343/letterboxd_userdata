The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension,15 Jan 2024,★★★★½,False,
Mamma Mia!,14 Jan 2024,★★★,False,
Lilo & Stitch,14 Jan 2024,★★★★,False,
The Great Muppet Caper,10 Jan 2024,★★★½,False,Not as laugh-out-loud funny as some of the other ones but this is still delightful as hell. The musical scene choreography is AMAZING and there's a heaping of good ol' spectacle in this. I think my favorite song was the first one but Piggy's synchronized swimming scene was also SO good
Forces of Nature,04 Jan 2024,★★★,False,Ok this movie is shot like a music video but I kinda love that? Honestly I respect a director who doesn't care about subtlety and the scene at the end with rose petals flying around in a hurricane was like if John Woo made a romcom
The Super Mario Bros. Movie,31 Dec 2023,★★½,False,
Bottoms,30 Dec 2023,★★★★,False,
Bridget Jones's Diary,27 Dec 2023,★★★★,False,
The Boy and the Heron,26 Dec 2023,★★★½,False,
Die Hard,24 Dec 2023,★★★½,False,
Godzilla Minus One,13 Dec 2023,★★★½,False,
Bullet Train,10 Dec 2023,★★★,False,"This wanted to be a Guy Ritchie movie SO bad. I liked it more than I expected to, but I was bothered by Masi Oka and Karen Fukuhara's maybe 6 cumulative lines total, the fact that 3 different characters are getting revenge for their wife's murder, and just being a little too weird about Japan."
Stardust,06 Dec 2023,★★★★,False,
The Birdcage,05 Dec 2023,★★★½,False,Movies that make me wish I could go to South Beach in the 90s
Jumanji,04 Dec 2023,★★★★,False,"I've seen this movie roughly 40 times and just today did I realize Alan's dad and Van Pelt are played by the same guy. Anyway, this movie is just SO good, I've been obsessed with the animatronic lion in this for 28 years"
Gremlins,04 Dec 2023,★★★,False,This gets pretty gross for being rated PG lol
Knocked Up,03 Dec 2023,★★★,False,
White Christmas,02 Dec 2023,★★★★,False,
Escape to Witch Mountain,01 Dec 2023,★★★,False,"I used to rent this over and over as a kid and I can see why, this movie has everything: psychic orphans, puppets, animal companions, escaping from a rich weirdo's mansion, unbridled use of greenscreens, a great score, and even RVs. Love the scenes that are supposed to take place outside at night but are clearly filmed in broad daylight with a filter."
While You Were Sleeping,30 Nov 2023,★★★★,False,
Adventures in Babysitting,30 Nov 2023,★★★,False,
Theater Camp,29 Nov 2023,★★★½,False,I did theatre when I was in middle school and did go to a theatre day camp so I'm obviously the target demographic for this but it really delivers. The final performance at the end is also really good and I did tear up! It was very sweet okay!!
Strange Days,22 Nov 2023,★★½,False,"I'm sorry, I couldn't suspend my disbelief to believe that Tom Sizemore with an awful wig could bag Juliette Lewis. Also I'm generally fine with longer movies but parts of this really dragged for me."
The Fifth Element,18 Nov 2023,★★★★,False,
Young Frankenstein,17 Nov 2023,★★½,False,
Frankenstein,17 Nov 2023,★★½,False,"Visually, it still looks great, but in my opinion that's the only thing going for it. Granted I'm way too familiar with the book and couldn't stop wondering why the filmmakers made the changes they did (making Victor and Henry brothers and basically giving Henry Victor's character arcs). Also like only two people died???? A very low stakes Frankenstein."
10 Things I Hate About You,16 Nov 2023,★★★,False,
Scream 2,15 Nov 2023,★★★½,False,"I really liked all of the stuff about the Stab movie, ngl. Also I'd love to see an Iliad and/or Agamemnon production that looked that sick"
