American Fiction,02 Jan 2024,★★★★,False,
Blue Beetle,30 Dec 2023,★★★,False,
Maestro,25 Dec 2023,★★★,False,"Impressive acting, makeup, cinematography, and direction. The story didn’t do it for me. There weren’t any plot holes or bad dialogue, simply I left feeling unsure what (if anything) Cooper wanted to tell his audience. The story just didn’t feel significant enough— is there a deeper meaning?"
The Boy and the Heron,19 Dec 2023,★★★½,False,This demands a rewatch
No Hard Feelings,14 Dec 2023,★★★½,False,I was so surprised at how much I liked this film. I had some great laughs. Really solid for what it is and worth a watch.
Poor Things,12 Dec 2023,★★★★,False,Super fun film! It felt a bit weird that it’s directed by a man though. And the last story point about her interacting with the Victoria element felt tacked on unnecessarily.
Memories of Murder,10 Dec 2023,★★★★,False,
Israelism,27 Nov 2023,★★★½,False,Very worth a watch. This really resonated for me.  Highly recommend.
Eternals,11 Nov 2023,★★,False,This one is pretty bad. I hope Chloe Zhao at least got her bag. That being said the cast was amazing.
The Place Beyond the Pines,03 Nov 2023,★★★½,False,"I watched this on airplane, so that wasn’t ideal. It felt too long but I did love the inter generational perspective."
Talk to Me,31 Oct 2023,★★½,False,"They did some really cool things in this one but it was ultimately pretty tough to watch. Solid ending and great acting but dang it was intense. I watched this on Halloween in theaters, so that’s fun!"
The Holdovers,23 Oct 2023,★★★★½,True,"a really great all around film. There aren’t enough films coming out anymore that features the relationship between people AND leave you smiling. This was so satisfying, heartfelt, and funny."
Oppenheimer,10 Oct 2023,★★★½,False,
Collateral,08 Oct 2023,★★★½,False,
Burnt,05 Oct 2023,★★★,False,A chef person I worked with said this film was the most realistic depiction of elite culinary restaurants seen on screen. She didn’t like the Bear :(. 
The Creator,03 Oct 2023,★★★½,False,"This film was shot on a $4,000 camera and looks stunning. I still don’t entirely understand why they went with this choice but it certainly didn’t matter because wow— it’s gorgeous. It’s nothing too special on the plot side. We’ve seen this film before but I’d still much rather see this than another sequel/remake."
Searching for Sugar Man,30 Sep 2023,★★★★,False,
Paddington,31 Aug 2023,★★★★,False,"Well, I finally watched it. And yes it was so good. I loved all the references to other films. This one felt like a movie that I grew up on, it feels older than it is in the best way possible."
