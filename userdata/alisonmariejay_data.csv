On the Town,06 Jan 2024,★★½,False,"I hate to say it, but I found this a little boring. None of the musical numbers were really memorable. The three leads are incredibly talented and charming, but they weren’t enough to make me love this."
Phoenix Rising,29 Dec 2023,★★★★½,False,
No Hard Feelings,26 Dec 2023,★★★★½,True,Didn’t expect this to make me cry! 
The Muppet Christmas Carol,22 Dec 2023,★★★★,False,"More Muppet remakes of classic literature, please!"
Nate Bargatze: The Tennessee Kid,18 Nov 2023,★★★★½,True,
I Want You Back,18 Nov 2023,★★★★,True,Jenny Slate and Charlie Day have undeniable chemistry and are such perfect romcom leads it’s a wonder they’d never been in this type of movie before.
Cradle Did Fall,15 Nov 2023,,False,"This is NOT a good movie. However, if you’re looking for something that’s “so bad it’s good” or a movie that nails all the tropes of a standard Lifetime movie, look no further."
Oklahoma!,03 Nov 2023,★★,False,Long and oddly paced.
American Manhunt: The Boston Marathon Bombing,21 Oct 2023,★★★,False,"As a New Englander who worked as a journalist in 2013, I feel a particular kind of investment in the story, because it really did consume all coverage during the hunt for the brothers. I really hated the back-patting by law enforcement, though, who are truly lucky an innocent civilian wasn’t killed during two excessive shootouts, and I find the overt jingoism of “Boston Strong” to make my skin crawl. Footage of the Boston bros wearing Brady jerseys and waving American flags in the streets after the younger brother was captured is just gross."
Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,15 Oct 2023,★★★★★,True,"I laughed, I cried, I sang, I danced 💜"
Theater Camp,13 Oct 2023,★★★½,False,Noah Galvin is a STUNNING woman.
Low Country: The Murdaugh Dynasty,30 Sep 2023,,False,
Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,22 Sep 2023,★★½,False,Zombie Strange is very Billy Butcherson-coded.
Singin' in the Rain,19 Aug 2023,★★★★,True,I’m embarrassed that it’s taken me almost 36 years to watch this movie for the first time.
"Red, White & Royal Blue",15 Aug 2023,★★★,False," RW&RB is one of my favorite books, so I approached this movie very warily. It has the look and feel of a big budget Lifetime movie and the two leads could have better chemistry, but it was a fun, sweet romcom. Don’t try to do a 1:1 comparison to the book, because the movie will significantly fall short, but if you take it as a separate entity, it’s a decent movie! (I wish this had been adapted into a miniseries… "
