The Book of Clarence,15 Jan 2024,★★½,False," I have no idea who this is for? Sorely lacking in the explosive energy and humor that made THE HARDER THEY FALL such a standout, with an extremely earnest and reverent finale sure to alienate audiences expecting more of a biblical parody. Entirely too long at over two hours, it meanders along at a sporadically amusing pace for the first half (David Oyelowo has a funny bit as a slap-happy John the Baptist) but never picks up any real steam.… "
Touch of Evil,15 Jan 2024,★★★★,False," I feel like this was the TRANSPARENT of its time (hear me out). Welles went out of his way to tell a story about the corrosive effect of corrupt racist American policing on Mexican border towns, specifically changing the source novel’s protagonist to a Mexican man. Except said Mexican man is played by CHARLTON HESTON IN BROWNFACE. And we also have Marlene Dietrich in brownface. So, like TRANSPARENT, however well-intended this film is becomes forever marred by its casting. Also,… "
Our Dancing Daughters,14 Jan 2024,★★★,False,"Can’t believe Joan gets out-hussied! Thank goodness flapper hair went out of style, it didn’t suit her bone structure. I spent most of the movie trying to figure out which male actors were gay and my best guess is all of them?"
The Ballad of Little Jo,13 Jan 2024,★★★½,False," Yentl Goes West! Early ‘90s white feminism distilled into a compelling historical fable. Supposedly based on a true story, although we can’t know if the real Jo identified as male for reasons beyond survival, the only one presented here. There’s some nascent queerness in all the gender confusion from men’s and women’s responses to Jo, but the “Tinman” storyline is hard to swallow; the optics of an Asian man being forced into a subservient position to Jo, and seeming content… "
Salvation!,12 Jan 2024,★,False," I don’t know what I thought I was getting here—I expected some kind of ‘80s televangelist parody that happens to feature a cool cast. The last thing I expected was this shrieky, obvious, Alex Cox-wannabe “takedown” of religious hypocrisy. This is one of those grating movies where the actors all scream at each other from the very first scene in a way that suggests the director just unleashed them without much guidance. It maintains this wildly overwrought yet serious “we’re… "
The Sunday Woman,11 Jan 2024,★★★½,False,"What a kooky little mystery! Lots of deadpan humor and even occasional flashes of farce. Most remarkably, it’s a star-studded 1975 film that gives us a gay relationship at the center of its story—not only that, but the more flamboyant Lello is the closest thing it has to a hero. It lost me as some kind of social critique on the Turin bourgeoisie or whatever; Jacqueline Bisset is gorgeous but lifeless as a socialite suspect. But Mastroianni and the other detectives are quite amusing, as are the various surly townspeople. Throw in a fuck-forest and a killer phallus and you have an offbeat, enjoyable Italian yarn."
"Dance, Fools, Dance",10 Jan 2024,★★★,False,"Falls apart whenever Joan isn’t onscreen (which is too often, especially in the second act) and feels way longer than its 81 minutes, but whewwwww the HEAT between Crawford and Gable is entirely worth the price of admission"
Mean Girls,10 Jan 2024,★★★½,False,"Okay this was PERFECTLY cute and serviceable. I lol’d a LOT at the new jokes and gags, there are some true standout performances (Bebe Wood! Jacquel Spivey!), I loved the references to the original wardrobe (hello Cady’s black tube dress with pink bra straps). Will I ever choose to watch this over the original? Unlikely! But I had a good time."
Ladies They Talk About,09 Jan 2024,★★★½,False,Pre-Code Stanwyck >>>>>
Coming Home,08 Jan 2024,★★★½,False,"I’m not sure what I thought this would be, but definitely not a love triangle with a Forrest Gump soundtrack. This is probably the closest Jon Voight ever came to his daughter’s unhinged magnetism; it’s his GIRL INTERRUPTED, right down to the hospital setting and Oscar win. Bruce Dern is scary good. The way Jane Fonda keeps her arms out during the climax is psychotic. Nearly passed out when I realized that Vi is Pauline Fleming from HEATHERS (“Thank you Ms. Fleming, you call me when the shuttle lands.”)"
T.R. Baskin,07 Jan 2024,★★★★,False,"Kinda like LOOKING FOR MR. GOODBAR without the traumatizing finale, although that film had me trained to expect Boyle to go ape on Bergen before she could leave the hotel room. While this can’t shake that sense of being a film about the female experience that was written and directed by 1971-era men, Candice Bergen is just so damn good and funny that the whole movie works. Peter Boyle almost made me cry and even James Caan has some tender moments. A hidden gem. Thanks Fun City!"
Cemetery Man,03 Jan 2024,★★★,False,"Maybe I’d love this more if I were (a) a student of Italian horror or (b) had first seen it on late night cable as a teenager. Watching it for the first time now, I found it rather dry and unamusing. Works best as a showcase for Rupert Everett (at his frequently undressed physical prime) in an understated anti-hero leading role that lets his rakish charm thrive as much as his abs."
