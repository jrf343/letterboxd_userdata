American Fiction,01 Jan 2024,★★★½,False,Sweet and good ending
The Iron Claw,26 Dec 2023,★★★,False,Very emotional and well acted and at points very funny but all that could not save what was ultimately a poorly directed film w bad pacing and super dumb script. Almost upsetting how good the emotional scenes were and how undeserved they felt compared to how mediocre the rest of the movie was

Killers of the Flower Moon,29 Oct 2023,★★★★½,False, I thought it did an excellent job displaying how dreadful this story was. So jovial and free flowing for the first part of the film which felt very weird and undeserved building until the film’s highest point of tension with the explosion. The pain held by the Osage characters was felt throughout. The viewer was an idle witness to a horrible display of white supremacy and capitalism’s preference for white people over anyone.I hear people on the criticism that… 
Phantom Thread,10 Oct 2023,★★★★½,False,"Beauuuuutiful I loved it. Idk why 4.5 instead of 5, maybe because it dragged at parts and felt somewhat predictable toward the end, but I'd gladly watch it again and probably would up the score. Did NOT help that I was freaking out over some shit I wrote about Palestine on Instagram right before I watched it and lotsa zionists got mad at me"
