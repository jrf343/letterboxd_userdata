Submarine,05 Jan 2024,★★★★,True,
Godzilla Minus One,29 Dec 2023,★★★★★,True,Just so good. Really compelling story and good visuals. No notes
The Many Saints of Newark,28 Dec 2023,★★½,True,A decent hit of the Sopranos universe. Michael Gandolfini is a gem. A lot of the characters were a bit over the top (Silvio’s actor doing his SVZ’s exact old man mannerisms as a young man seemed strange to me). The Dickie/his dad beef was so random. The Junior/Dickie beef makes noooo sense at all. I do appreciate the lore building. Worth seeing if you’re craving more after the show like the junkie you are.
Pink Flamingos,24 Dec 2023,★★★★★,True,This movie is deranged. Horrific. A work of art. Would recommend it but make sure you know what you’re getting into
Naked Lunch,22 Dec 2023,★★★★★,True,It is a work of art. Extremely weird but like so good at it
The Boy and the Heron,17 Dec 2023,★★★,True,I don’t know why I was a little disappointed but I was - I guess I didn’t get what I was supposed to get out of it. The Ghibli floor is very high so it’s still worth seeing. Maybe I’ll rewatch it when I’m not sick and my brain works lol
Monsters University,26 Nov 2023,★★★,True,"Glad I watched it. Full of tropes but very watchable and entertained my home full of mid-20s year olds. I love a message of self-acceptance and was therefore really pleased to learn what had actually happened at the end of the Scare Games with Mike. Points taken off for weird character arcs of the non-main characters/one-dimensionality - like what’s Randall’s problem all of a sudden? I also feel like the ROR guys were fairly flat, though that is more believable. Anyway, worth a see if you’re a fan of the first, or if, of course, you are a child."
Killers of the Flower Moon,19 Nov 2023,★★★★,True,
Fantastic Planet,17 Nov 2023,★★★½,True,What a trip. Really cool concept and enjoyable. Yadda-yadda-yadda’d over what felt like important parts. Slightly disappointed in the swiftness of the resolution. Visually stunning and enjoyable worldbuilding. Would recommend.
A Nightmare on Elm Street,07 Nov 2023,★★★,True,"I actually thought it was pretty scary at points. Some unlikable characters, but what are you gonna do. Freddy himself is a big cornball and not that scary. I loved Glen’s crop top outfit at the end too"
Friday the 13th,05 Nov 2023,★★½,False,"Kind of mid. Had its moments. I enjoyed the score and the cinematography, particularly of the lake in the morning. Some of the athletic feats by the killer are not really explained. I’d watch the sequel but not in a hurry."
Candyman,04 Nov 2023,★★★★,True,"This movie has such strange vibes. Amazing cinematography, and I can see a lot of it has influenced Jordan Peele movies. There’s lots of really suspenseful moments and it is creepy without being gratuitous. I can’t say I really get the whole curse / situation toward the end, but that’s fine. Would recommend."
X,02 Nov 2023,★★★½,True,"A fun combo of scary, spicy and fun. A little silly sometimes. Really hate the old person prosthetics. Camera man was done dirty I’ll tell you what. Worth a see, looking forward to watching Pearl."
Scream,31 Oct 2023,★★★★★,True,"I guess it's a classic for a reason. Seemed a little silly or corny sometimes, but the movie leaned into it and it worked. It was sometimes scary and sometimes funny, but always engaging. Was enjoyable to see the tropes before they were tropes. I really enjoyed Matthew Lillard's character."
