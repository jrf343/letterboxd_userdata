The Prom,15 Dec 2020,★★★★,False," Whatever! I enjoyed it. I just hate the idea that's easily perpetuated and is also mentioned in this film, that theatre/cinema is a distraction... a part of the ideological state apparatus that acts as an escape for the mundane lives of the people. As if saying that it is a good thing. We'll I use to believe it to be that way too. But I protest to that idea now. Cinema isn't just an escape or a distraction. It can… "

Cuties,12 Sep 2020,★★★★,False," What do you see?I see a child navigating the hardship of growing up as a minority, as a Muslim, an 11-year old going thru changes in her body, a young girl starting to see her sense of identity thru media representations, seeing validation thru likes and hearts on social media. Overall she just wanted to express her self with dancing and belong to a group of girls she thought are so cool.But what others see is a movie… "

Mulan,05 Sep 2020,★★,False," With two sets of writers no wonder some parts of it are confusing. One, in particular, is Mulan's sudden need to reveal herself as a woman. But why? It was explained in such a way through the Witch's dialogue that by concealing her ""true"" self it poisons her chi... but what is chi exactly? From what I get it's the ""force"" and it's strong in Mulan and the Witch. So she did it to make herself stronger? If so it… "

Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,20 Aug 2020,★★★,False,It was fun and the songs are great. If you took this movie seriously then go assess your life. Sigrit was awesome as a character albeit the cringy lip sync but whatever ot was funny and I cried at that last song. So buzz off!

Late Night,19 Mar 2020,★★★½,False," Pretty sure it doesn't happen in real life, but work-life realism doesn't matter if a film made you feel good and happy watching it. The illusion it plays that makes you forgive the implausiblities because it connects to something human. Not to mention it makes you forget those implausiblities. Real good. The trope in here written by Mindy Kaling is a gem hidden in the ocean of streaming service. Though entirely reminicent of The Devil Wears Prada, Late Night is… "
