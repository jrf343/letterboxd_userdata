Oppenheimer,14 Jan 2024,★★★★½,False,A rewarding movie if you can make it through all of it. 
Foe,06 Jan 2024,★★★½,False," Difficult to watch - slow and dreary but also unsettling and upsetting. Paul always makes me upset. He’s good at that and playing the man who could’ve done more. His characters are always falling short of something, while Saoirse’s are headstrong ladies being held back. The world was left to pretty shots of rustic sparseness and pale colors - not a full world there to understand, but perhaps that’s okay. Conceptually, the plot twist is reminiscent of Shutter Island and… "
Saltburn,01 Jan 2024,★★★★,False,We Have Always Lived in the Castle meets Call Me by Your Name meets Emma Cline’s The Guest.
Fallen Leaves,26 Dec 2023,★★★,False,"A movie that feels like a movie when you watch it yet doesn’t do what a lot of movies tend to do. Namely, the sparkling wine is given the space to sizzle in the glasses."
Napoleon,22 Dec 2023,★★★,False,Give me more Joséphine and less Boney 💁🏻‍♀️
May December,20 Dec 2023,★★★★,False," When you Google the movie, the genre listed is “Romance/Comedy” and IMBD has it as a Comedy & Drama, which I think is someone on the media team being smart so the campy meta plot of the film hits you harder. I try to know as little as possible about a film before I see it. This one took me off guard. It creeps in on you - at first quickly (wait did Julianne Moore and that teenage-looking man just kiss?)… "
The Lobster,16 Dec 2023,★★★★★,False,(Rewatched to write a paper on it) Excellent lil posthuman diddy
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,12 Dec 2023,,False,Watched this merely so I could contextualize the amazing meme-like reviews. Thank you Letterboxd and the category of Bleach Blonde Man
Past Lives,05 Dec 2023,★★★★★,False," I cried 2-3 times. Very complicated personal experience for me. First, it was in the Louis Hartlooper in Utrecht, so naturally all the subtitles were in Dutch — including the Korean parts — leaving half of the spoken language in a sense twice removed for me. I had to first filter through the Dutch subtitles, which I could make out only ~een klein beetje~ (a little bit) and which translated the Korean being spoken — a language I was born… "
