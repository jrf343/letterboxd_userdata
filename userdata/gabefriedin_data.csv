The Worst Person in the World,22 Feb 2022,,False," the dialogue was the most intriguing part of this whole thing, not even because of the substance but just because Norwegian is a crazy language. it was enough to keep my attention.seeing this film brought me back to the time i took acid in Barcelona with Morgs and Fiona. after a full day of bright light and general overstimulation we sat in PlaÃ§a del Sol drinking Estrellas and tried to get a sense of the people around us inâ€¦ "
"Diaries, Notes, and Sketches",17 Feb 2022,,False,this was an absolutely surreal experience after taking probably 40mg of adderall throughout the course of the day and iâ€™ll just leave it at that
The Lady Eve,14 Feb 2022,,True,gets better every time
Society,04 Feb 2022,,False,
Parallel Mothers,03 Feb 2022,,True,"brilliantly well-rounded moral melodrama. itâ€™s cool how almÃ³vodar keeps you guessing while sort of staying within the bounds of a generic structure (bonding, betrayal, resolution/redemption). birth, death, past and future are explored through this modern story, against a backdrop of a very complicated history; one that still plagues Spain to this day across generations. redemption has yet to be fully realized in Spain, even almost 50 years after the transition to democracy. i thought the final scene summed up everything perfectly.Â "
Claire's Camera,30 Jan 2022,,False,
Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me,29 Jan 2022,,True," forgot i had seen this before but that was also before watching season 3 of the series, which blew my fucking mind, as well as this 4.5 hour comprehensive and surprisingly convincing analysis of the whole 9 yards. Sheryl Lee is a very powerful actress and David Lynch is a sick man! and one mustn't forget big Brooklyn guy Angelo Badalamenti's perfect scoring. the film is significantly darker than the series, which incorporates a wider set of narrative styles thatâ€¦ "
Orpheus,27 Jan 2022,,True,so epic. intelligently written and directed. clear influence on Lynch and perfect viewing before the midnight showing of Fire Walk With Me ðŸ˜Ž
France,05 Jan 2022,,True,the medium is the message ðŸ’¡
The Girl Who Believes in Miracles,01 Jan 2022,,False," almost forgot to log this one. we felt like we needed a miracle to start of the new year and lo and behold. for a bunch of G*d-fearing folks these mugs were quite reluctant to believe this absolute gem of a little girl wasn't making shit happen, straight up denying what was happening right in front of their eyes. like bruv she just cured cancer AND paralysis by praying? and learned how to draw religious iconography worthy of the METâ€¦ "
