Glass Onion,02 Jan 2023,★★★,False,
Triangle of Sadness,02 Jan 2023,★★★★,True,"Drags on and would benefit from some theme subtlety, but stick around for the ending. A chef’s kiss."
The Banshees of Inisherin,28 Dec 2022,★★★★,True,
The Tender Bar,28 Dec 2022,★★★,True,
Babylon,26 Dec 2022,★★★½,True,
In the Bedroom,23 May 2022,★★★½,False,
The Lost City,18 May 2022,★★,False,"I thought it would be fun, and at times it sort of is. The movie is mostly drivel though. Corny dialogue and poor use of Channing T, who showed serious chops with 21 and 22 Jump Street. All his jokes in this come off as cheesy."
Dog Day Afternoon,15 May 2022,★★★★,True,"Took too long to see this. Pacino reminds us that there was an era before Jack & Jill, he’s fantastic. Fun dialogue and good story, I’ll end up watching this again soon."
The Insider,12 May 2022,★★½,False,"Just gonna say it, Michael Mann movies are too long."

Witness for the Prosecution,29 Jan 2022,★★★★½,True,
The Last Duel,24 Jan 2022,★★★,False,"It’s good action and the haircuts are fun. The three storyline perspectives are kinda exhausting, I almost rewinded to confirm I wasn’t rewatching the same scene. But, all in all worth it for the duel (last one) and it’s a half baked return to gladiator form from Ridley."

The Celebration,17 Dec 2021,★★★,True,"Not vint’s best but I see the arc, also would’ve left this celebration if I was a guest. By any means"
Ghostbusters: Afterlife,11 Dec 2021,★★★,True,It’s a fun one. Ghost harold Ramis is a generous depiction tho
