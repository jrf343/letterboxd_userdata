Plague,11 Jan 2024,★★½,True," В чумаво време жълтиците нямат стойностI loved the idea of a Yordan Yovkov text being adapted, since there's a reason we study him in primary school. ""През Чумавото"" specifically has a lot of potential for my kind of screen adaptation since it's set in that awkward pre-liberation period of Bulgarian history in the early 19th century, when our community is too preoccupied with preserving itself among the Ottomans that we seldom notice tumultuous historical events happening around us, kind… "
A View To Kill For,10 Jan 2024,½,False,Jesus Christ. I guess it takes a movie as horrifically stupid as this to enrage me enough to come out of letterboxd exile. I bore witness to this brain rot against my will last time I was as my mom's for dinner and just ... I gotta exert some more control over what she sees on TV.
Fool's Paradise,15 May 2023,★,False," Oh boy. I absolutely adore Charlie Day and this is hot garbage. Sadly not the entertaining kind but the fight off falling asleep in the theater kind.This picture's concerningly long list of producers trusting Charlie to write and direct his own feature is one of the filmic equivalents of the Beatles letting Ringo write weird shit every now and then. And it's truly IASIP Charlie fever dream dumb. I was anticipating some of that, but more as a play… "
The Whale,17 Mar 2023,★★½,True," The most entertaining thing about this 6pm screening was everyone in the Lyric Tiki lounge (myself included) munching on various dinner items - sometimes in unison with Charlie, sometimes holding off in awkward moments of solidarity when the corpulence got too high-impact.I've been wired to comb through debates on universal truths lately and I was easily provoked by all the sentimentality here. I'm afraid if you remove all the (interesting and seldom explored) entanglements of the New Life Church,… "
Inside,16 Mar 2023,★★★½,True," Nobody here but us pigeons, RIGHT?Premiere review - the meager turnout doesn't give this fantastic performance justice. See it, pay for it, make Vasilis happy. This past semester comprised of academic analysis of schlock and Korean film history has me craving shit like this and yes, it's great to consume with the added faculty of way too much film philosophy.Willem Dafoe going insane in various confined spaces is among my favorite genres. Barely any dialogue, this is the… "

Troll 2,23 Jan 2023,★½,True," Still can't believe I got to see this on a (repurposed lecture hall) big screen with a dozen like-minded film nerds. Props to Scott Diffrient for whatever strings he pulled for Badfilm to become a recognized course. Truly, one of the best bad films out there Unordered thoughts:- Fragasso's wife wrote the screenplay to dunk on vegetarians- The local Utah folks kept trying to correct Fragasso and his Italian crew's English but they insisted they knew it perfectly… "
The Electrical Life of Louis Wain,21 Jan 2023,★★½,True," Another one of the films I never caught back at TFF48. Better acquaint myself with Will Sharpe with this before White Lotus I figure. Louis Wain is nice, but it strikes me as the work of a director who's maybe trying a little too hard to establish a trademark style, uncertain and derivative of Anderson whimsy where it can be bold and new. I do jive with the timidness though. I feel at home with this character raised by women… "
Within Our Gates,19 Jan 2023,★★★,False," Woodrow Wilson said of Birth of a Nation ""It's like writing history with lightning. My only regret is that it is all so terribly true"". This kind of appalling response was the exigence for Micheaux to portray Black masculinity and femininity as it was in the reality of Dixie racism when a black man could be lynched for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. And it's a pretty good film, too. Some more thoughts in no order:… "
