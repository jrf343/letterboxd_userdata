Malcolm X,23 Nov 2021,,False,
Louder Than a Bomb,23 Oct 2021,★★★★½,False,"Watching this was an assignment for a psych class but maybe it's better suited for a social justice class. Classic case of positivity being held in higher regard than say, exposing trauma or shining light on problems. Aside, I fucking love slam and love Chicago so this was a treat."
Nine Perfect Strangers,27 Sep 2021,★★★★½,False,Excellent study on trauma and on hallucinogenic therapy. I hope lots of people watch this and it helps people find healing. Fuck knows we need it.
Reminiscence,19 Sep 2021,★★★,False,"The best visualization I've seen of ""the new normal"" post sea-level rise. I wanna hear what the climate adaptation folks have to say about this one. Aside from the production design, things were kinda dull and slow. It felt too fixated on romantic betrayal when it had a foundation fit for something more complex and current. Harder with the anti-barons! (me yelling at the tv)---What do you get if you cross Strange Days with Bladerunner? Miami never looked so good."

"sex, lies, and videotape",01 May 2021,★★★★★,True,
If a Tree Falls: A Story of the Earth Liberation Front,24 Apr 2021,★★★★★,True," It's especially interesting to watch this now, the week a cop was found guilty of murdering George Floyd and the day the Portland mayor asked citizens to call the police on people wearing all black. Use of force, double standards, property over lives, trying and succeeding but also failing... Things are changing but fuck, why's it taking so damn long?! Aside, the documentary helped me understand the history of ELF and how people can become more radicalized. The questions on terrorism… "
Shithouse,23 Apr 2021,★★★★,True,
The Humanity Bureau,23 Apr 2021,,False,
The United States vs. Billie Holiday,13 Apr 2021,★★★★★,True," It's clear Andra Day has a deep understanding and respect for ""Lady Day"" and she truly did her justice. We need more narratives like this, especially those portraying real people who've struggled so very much and somehow find the strength to keep getting back up and continuing the fight. Even as she was breathing her last breathes they still found it necessary to cuff her. All for singing a song. Many years ago I had a  friend who was a… "
kid 90,24 Mar 2021,★★,False,I'm not the audience for this. It's for those privileged to have not been forced to face suicide from a young age. I can't understand how it took her decades and multiple friends killing themselves to wake up. As much as I hate stereotypes I found myself wondering if this was a certain type of Karen. Woke Karen? Anywayzzz.
Richard Pryor: Live on the Sunset Strip,27 Feb 2021,★★★★★,True,
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,27 Feb 2021,,False,"Flame Monroe speaking a truth I haven't yet heard: ""It is safer for me to tell the police if I get pulled over that I'm trans than it is for me to say I'm a Black man."""
Honey,26 Feb 2021,★★½,False,I'm a sucker for dance movies but ain't no need to watch this again. The acting feels very after-school-special and dulls the coolness of having all the 90s R&B peeps. But yay for standing up to skeezy bosses and for communities building their own thing.
Coming to America,21 Feb 2021,,True,
Her Smell,19 Feb 2021,★★★★,False," This was hard to watch. Caring about a narcissist is tough on its own, much less watching them bottom out, spiral in delusions, and lash out at everyone around them. This movie put me back in those feels, which is great for the-power-of-film but not so great for trauma. Another big thing about 'Her Smell' is how well they captured how it felt to be a part of a certain culture and a certain period of time. It's easy to… "
Bernie,07 Feb 2021,★★★½,False,"The story of Bernie Tiede is a testament to the power of social capital and to how little a woman need do to have her murder justified. (Meanwhile men do far worse to women and suffer less consequence.)  Seeing behind ""The Pine Curtain"" was the best part of the movie. In some ways I hope there's a remake or follow up that goes deeper into Bernie being abused as a child or the new evidence that surfaced and it leading to Bernie living with Linklater."
12 Years a Slave,05 Feb 2021,★★★★★,False,
Bombshell,30 Jan 2021,★★★★,False,"If white women seen as beautiful by the powerful are afraid to speak up, imagine what it's like for everyone else. Too many dudes have said things to me like, ""It's easy to speak up"", ""Why's it a big deal to come forward?"", or the worst of the worst -- ""She's lying.""  Head explosion. Aside, this movie gives voice where it's usually neglected and I appreciate it. I'm also thankful I waited until after 45 was outta office to watch it."
The Craft: Legacy,14 Jan 2021,★★★½,False,
Yearly Departed,09 Jan 2021,★★★½,False,
Cane River,29 Dec 2020,★★★★,True,"This sits best as a study on race relations and on a part of Louisiana culture rarely seen in media. The romantic scenes are heavy handed and off-putting, but the narrative around his great-grandmother having been a freed slave who owned the largest plantation in the area makes it worth the watch. I especially loved the cinema verite feel and the strong sense of place. Having grown up in Louisiana, I appreciated how authentic the footage felt and I'm so thankful the negatives were recovered and restored."
