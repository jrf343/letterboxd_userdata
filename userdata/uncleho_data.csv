Past Lives,29 Dec 2023,★★★★½,False,"Loved this. Felt incredibly lived, accurate, humane, complex, and understated. A snapshot of life, and the paths not taken, with all the complications that come with that."
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,07 Dec 2023,★★★½,False,"ohhhhhhhh, Snow’s the villain. "
A Haunting in Venice,17 Sep 2023,★★★★,False,"A bit too spooky for me, but I’m a scaredy cat. I was surprised though that finally a Branagh Poirot was actually good. Keeping it confined to one location helped focus it."
"Red, White & Royal Blue",18 Aug 2023,★★★,True," On a rewatch, I still had fun with it. Going in knowing what I was gonna get made it more enjoyable to watch. But I do miss the nuance and subtlety from the book. There’s a lot of choices that are made to get this to a two hour minute movie.  Characters and plots are cut and sometimes replaced (most egregious IMO is the creation of Miguel, the Hot Bad Gay Journalist Ex-Hookup, who is a poor amalgamation of four… "
Oppenheimer,30 Jul 2023,★★★★★,False,So worth seeing this in 70mm IMAX.
Happy Together,25 Jul 2023,★★★,False,"Expected to like this more than I did. In the end, I found it frequently dull — I think the relentless negativity in the central relationship (and in the characters generally) just wore its welcome for me quite quickly, resulting in a morass of sadness that never became particularly interesting outside of a few sweet/poignant moments. A lot of stylistic choices also didn’t work for me, distracting from the story when I might otherwise be engaged. The tough thing is, I can see the artistry. But I just didn’t feel it."
Beyto,21 Jul 2023,★★,False," Look, you KNOW I love me a pair of men kissing while wearing speedos. You KNOW I love slow motion shots of a man swimming in water. You KNOW I love happy endings (in both senses of the phrase). But this did nothing for me, I’m afraid. Don’t get me wrong — the actor who plays Beyto is gorgeous, and I would happily stare into his eyes for eternity. The problem is Mike. I hate Mike with the passion of… "
Out in the Dark,20 Jul 2023,★★★½,False,"Okay, this is not an easy watch, but they are cute, so plus?"
Barbie,20 Jul 2023,★★★½,False,"Hmm, didn’t quite work for me. Very colorful, frequently funny, surprisingly airless (for Gerwig). Overall had a good time, but despite the color palette, it left me a bit cold."
Maurice,19 Jul 2023,★★★★★,True,I’ve got that Oscar Wilde thing going on too.
Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,19 Jul 2023,★★★★½,True,
Of an Age,19 Jul 2023,★★★★,True,"Watched this on a sick day, so I was shivering as they were crying. "
Titanic,19 Jul 2023,★★★★,False,"I can finally say I’ve seen this. I watched it with a nasty sore throat, so I was sipping soothing tea while watching people fall, drown, and scream to their deaths."
