In a Lonely Place,14 Aug 2020,★★,False,"Old movies can be good, there’s no denying that, but my god this was a sleeper. Legit made me wanna break my pill sobriety, predictable ending. Fuck Amani Marshall for showing me this piece of trash"
Jacob's Ladder,12 Sep 2019,★★★★½,True,Finally got around to watching this one. Unsettling and disturbing movie with an ending that makes you think. I can only dream of having a girlfriend as supportive as Jacobs 😩
Avengers: Endgame,12 Sep 2019,★★★★,True,"Finally watched this movie after getting it spoiled for me. Pretty entertaining, who cares that iron man dies Robert Downey jr. is such a prick in these movies, also captain America is such a bland character idc about him at all. I wonder what the next 90% cgi movie that the masses will praise as the greatest movie every will be."
It Chapter Two,12 Sep 2019,★★★,False,"Saw this movie the other night with my friend Sarah who I haven’t seen in a while. Took too much of an edible before arriving at the theater and nearly blacked out so I don’t really remember the movie, I was kinda scared sometimes tho, can someone tell me if this is worth seeing again? My sister has been begging to see a movie with me cuz I guess we don’t hang out enough"
