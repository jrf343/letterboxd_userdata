Leave the World Behind,16 Dec 2023,★★★,False,"My mom says it’s a true story and the Illuminati is gonna do that to us and that movie creators since the beginning of time have been trying to give us signs and hints and that they couldn’t have come up with all that if it wasn’t based on some truth and so it’s not all that unreal and science fictionary. So if this all comes true and someone out there stumbles upon a secret safe room watching Friends, and then this movie and then reads this review, my mom was right."
