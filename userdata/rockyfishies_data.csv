Homework,21 Dec 2023,★★★★½,True," My almost humiliating desperation to watch and make art that speaks as loudly as this has never wavered. I’ve written about Kiarostami a lot, words that I keep to myself, words that almost keep my heart beating. I’ve described his filmography as being “a home i could run to — a warm hug, a cup of tea, a date tree”. However, in many ways, Homework evades this description. It is a home I feel every emotion towards; it portrays the… "
the parade,21 Dec 2023,,True,"i just told gus this reminded me of that scene in asteroid city, and so i have to say that here as well. i think it’s really special when people are able to create something so emotionally loud with so little physical equipment. the awe the characters feel is so evident and is extended to the audience. gus this is amazing, with a whole crew behind you i can’t begin to imagine what you’ll do next."
Epilogue,21 Dec 2023,,True,"really poignant and thoughtful. for me, as a writer who is seemingly able to do anything but write, this stings. this encapsulates how i feel about writing, having to constantly reinvent what ‘good enough’ means, and where my standards lie. that makes it really special to me. my future classmates are so talented, giancarl this was beautiful!"

It all feels important, his unique portrayal of faith is something that I talked about in my review of The Seventh Seal, but in Winter Light he peels back another layer of the same puzzle and allows us to ponder and dive deeper into these ideas. We meet Tomas, a man living in a newly formed sense of absence in his faith as he desperately tries to find his way back.… "
45 Years,07 Feb 2021,★★★★,True," “She looks like she did in 1962 and I look like this.”Naturalistic, sober, and sincere. 45 Years defines the harsh reality of the passage of time, as it plays perhaps the most vital role in this film.

Gradual increase of silence, as the maze of growing older together grows more and more paths that lead nowhere. Haigh classifies time as… "
