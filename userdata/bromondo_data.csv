The Nun II,09 Sep 2023,★★½,False,"A part 2/direct continuation from the first Nun film. It was a better experience to see in an IMAX theatre. The Nun follows another simple plot and executed like every other conjuring movie before it, but it still managed to entertain me.. like the return of Bea Arthur as the headmistress getting ‘the drop’ on the Catholic church. The head to head nun-off at the end was somewhat disappointing for it to be leading up to a wine tasting though."
Infinity Pool,28 Aug 2023,★★½,False,"I enjoyed the concept, and the acting was definitely over the top and what I enjoyed the most about it, but it felt like a modern Clockwork Orange trying to be more pretentious without Malcom narrating part of the story."
Bones and All,28 Aug 2023,★★★,True,"I was expecting this to be at least partially horror adjacent and it has violence and gore, but the horror is just something else palpable not obvious enough to point out on screen. It’s also not just a teenage runaway love story  but it is a pretty good story and has a method of blending and building the essence from settings, music, emotions, and what home/safety should feel like."
Funeral Parade of Roses,19 Feb 2023,★★★½,True,"It’s brilliant while simple for todays standards but still remains effectively engaging with violence, dark humor and the realistic depravity of society that went on to influence the film A Clockwork Orange even though neither are as deep for being classified as high styled art pieces"
Velvet Buzzsaw,13 Sep 2022,★★,False,Satirical comedy horror about how we are the makers of our own mortality and how our vapid and superficial oversights lead to being hacks that critique the hard work of others while riding the coattails of reputable names for the sake of staying relevant.
The Feast,13 Sep 2022,★★★,False,"This felt like an Alex Garland film, and wouldn’t be surprised if it was adapted into a US remake. It’s a vexing and suspenseful story of a affluent husband and wife having a dinner party with their two entitled sons, and going off the rails into more than emotional family dis function."
Fantastic Fungi,13 Sep 2022,★★★★½,True,A visually stimulating documentary with plenty of insight to how the fungi kingdom operates and helps our planet. There is a lot of great discoveries in fungi and continue to teach scientists and medical specialists possible methods to cleaning up pollution and treating medical conditions.
Separation,13 Sep 2022,★★,False,Full of dream sequences and too many pauses that don’t build up enough tension to be scary. The creepy characters in the trailer are fleeting and forgettable during the viewing because of its stop/go momentum
Bodies Bodies Bodies,13 Sep 2022,★★★,True,"The next generations satirical thriller comedy with plenty of tense and funny moments, witty banter overlaying a social structure piece of over analyzing with minimal critical thinking skills which is similar to the arrogance of our instincts being tested before we truly understand who we are or how to be comfortable in the world we live in today."
Texas Chainsaw Massacre,21 Aug 2022,★★★,True,"Oh okay, I’m not supposed to like this one my bad."
Watcher,21 Aug 2022,★★★½,True,"Consistently tense and thrilling mystery that’s framed to give you the vantage view of what it’s like being a woman not taken seriously even if you feel like your gut instinct is the only thing to go off of.This film has great pacing, acting, and atmosphere for the storyline."
The Gray Man,21 Aug 2022,★★,False,"Mindless but entertaining action film with pretty good cinematic moments, just a simple predictable John Wick story plot"
